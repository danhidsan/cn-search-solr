Consider taking this photo when you exit the ship in the early morning for an excursion to take advantage of the beautiful morning light.  Or wait until the late afternoon when you return for a golden light like I did for this photo.

What about capturing a story of who they are and what they do. I love how Carina of [The Jet Set](http://www.jetsetcarina.com/) captured the waiters as they were getting the run down on the evening’s dinner menu. Changing it to black and white was a great choice because of the contrast in their black and white uniforms, and it drew our attention to the waiter’s face that much more.  ",

She hosts the Disney Junior TV show *Capture Your Story with Me Ra Koh*. Not only do tens of thousands of moms follow her blog for photo tips, travel inspiration and creative empowerment, but she also writes for Disney’s Babble and Conde Nast Traveler in which she inspires moms to not only capture their family but live their best life.  She is the author of the national bestselling series, *Your Baby in Pictures: The New Parents’ Guide to Photographing Your Baby’s First Year* and *Your Child in Pictures: The Parents’ Guide to Photographing Your Toddler and Child from Age One to Ten* and *Your Family in Pictures: The Parents’ Guide to Photographing Holidays, Family Portraits, and Everyday Life* reaching #1, #2 and #3 at the same time on Amazon’s Top 10 Best Seller List.

Her writing, photography, and photo recipes have been featured on *The Oprah Winfrey Show*, Lifetime Television, VH1, and Martha Stewart Living Radio, as well as in the *New York Times*, *Parenting*, *Yahoo Shine, American Baby, Women’s World, Associated Press, Huffington Post, Popular Photography, American Photo*, and *CLICK*. Her award winning photography has been exhibited from coast to coast. Her Egypt photography was given the honor of being on exhibit in The Natural History Museum in NYC.

The historic Upper East Side property, steps from Central Park, has also played host to visiting royals and heads of state, including the late Diana, Princess of Wales, and more recently, Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. But you don’t need to be a dignitary to visit. You don’t even need to book a room. Just act like a New Yorker and saunter into Bemelmans Bar just after 5 p.m., pull up a chair beneath the gold-plated ceiling, and enjoy live music as you sip your martini.\n \nIn this episode of *Hotel Stories* we speak with Bemelmans pianist Earl Rose, learn the art of the 30-second conversation from elevator operator Allen Davison, and catch a glimpse of those hand-monogrammed pillowcases. \n\nSubscribe to [Condé Nast Traveler on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/condenasttraveler) for the next installment of *Hotel Stories.*\n\n\n\n               [#iframe://www.youtube.com/embed/EgYO1DK5N9A]||||||",

There are certain cities that let you just be, and this is one.”\n\n##THE PLAN IS NO PLAN\n\nIn every couple, there’s always a designated planner. One example is Christine Amorose of the lifestyle blog [cestchristine.com](cestchristine.com). But for a recent trip to the Dominican Republic with her boyfriend, the only thing she booked in advance was the hotel. No restaurants, no activities—just four nights at [Casa Bonita in Barahona](http://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/baharona/casa-bonita-tropical-lodge). “It was sort of spontaneous, which took the pressure off me,” she says. “We were in it together.”\n\n##REWRITE THE SCRIPT\n\nWhen writer Ashlea Halpern’s boyfriend said he wanted clothes for his birthday, her initial thought was, *Boring!* But then she got to work on his real present. “I asked an art director friend to design a faux Topman gift card for $500, but I rewrote the fine print to say that it was redeemable at one specific Topman—the one in Prague, which I had booked a secret trip to,” she says. (And yes, he actually went to the Prague Topman.)\n\n##SPLURGE ON YOUR HOTEL\n\nYou’ll probably spend more time in the room when it’s just the two of you, so book one you’d want to sleep until noon in. The private *maisons* at [Auberge du Soleil in Napa Valley](http://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/st-helena/auberge-du-soleil--napa-valley) overlook the hills of wine country and come with a terrace, a fireplace, and a steam shower (for two, of course). On the East Coast, you won’t do better than the turret suite at the Castle Hill Inn in Newport, Rhode Island. The cozy, wood-paneled, bi-level suite has panoramic ocean views.\n\n##MAKE YOUR BUSINESS TRIP DO DOUBLE DUTY\n\nWherever interior designer Maca Huneeus and her vintner husband’s work takes them, they plot a trip to the most exotic place they can travel to easily—and quickly (they have four children back home). When her husband had to attend Vinexpo in Bordeaux, they used it as the jumping-off point for four nights at [La Maison Arabe](http://www.lamaisonarabe.com/) in Marrakech. “The more remote the place, the more bonding you do,” she says. “We’re in major cities all the time and know them so well. The unknown is much more romantic.” For L.A.–based photographer Dewey Nicks, however, getting away is less about place than a state of mind: “We tack shorter trips in the U.S. onto assignments and leave the kids with their grandparents.” And while it’s not Marrakech, it’s still romantic. “It’s nice to have a great dinner and stay in a hotel with your wife,” he says. “That and no jet lag make for a really good vacation.”\n\n*For more romantic travel ideas, check out our [Romantic Getaway Guide](https://cnt.conde.io/reports/special-report-romantic-getaway-guide).* ",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/54d29f0ff743358e0c1dc981]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nThose fluffy, white hotel towels may be a nice souvenir from your luxury hotel stay, but resist the temptation to tuck one inside your bag.\n\nHotels, which report losing up to 20 percent of their linens every month, are cracking down on linen theft with the help of an electronic tracking device sewn into towels, sheets and robes that can tell users when and where the items are being stolen. \n\nThe devise is barely perceptible to those who aren't looking for it, and sneakier still, Linen Tracking Technology, the company behind the microchip trackers, won’t reveal which hotels they're working with. \n\nThe company did say about 2,000 hotels now have their devices in their towels.\n\n“Our properties like to remain anonymous. They benefit from the gained efficiency and don’t want to alert guests that they have this technology,” William Serbin, executive vice president of Miami-based Linen Tracking Technology told the Daily Mail.\n\nWhile the company has been around for several years, more hotels in U.S. and overseas have been adopting the Linentracker chip, with some reporting a huge decrease in linen theft. The [Mr. C Hotel](http://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/los-angeles/mr--c-beverly-hills) in Beverly Hills [says the device reduced their rate of missing items](http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?10953/2) from between 20 to 30 percent each month down to just 3 percent.\n\nThe M&M candy-sized chip, which can be attached to linens, towels, or robes—and alerts managers to where they are at all times—can last through up to 300 wash cycles.\n\nThe company initially created the chip to allow hotels to keep better track of linens shipped to offsite cleaners, where the majority of theft of misplacement occurs—between 10 to 20 percent monthly, Serbin estimates. Two percent of hotel linen theft can be directly attributed to guests.\n\n“Our solution not only provides total inventory information, but provides additional data like dwell time, wash count, and laundry reconciliation, which assists properties become more efficient,” the executive vice president said.\n\nBut when one of the micro-chipped linens passes through a signal at the hotel’s entrance or exit, hoteliers are alerted that a towel has left the property. The chip does not currently report back the exact coordinates of the towel, but Serbin says hotels can make note of which guest stayed where in order to allow for better linen accounting.\n\n__More From FoxNews:__\n\n[Inside the $35G per night Vegas 'Sky Villa']\n(http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2015/02/04/inside-35k-night-vegas-sky-villa/)\n\n[Hotel rooms and guest fees to get more expensive this year]\n(http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2015/02/03/hotel-rooms-and-guest-fees-to-get-more-expensive-this-year/)\n\n[Luxury cruise features $10,000 per night suite as large as a house]\n(http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2015/02/02/140000-for-luxury-maiden-voyage-cruise/)",
