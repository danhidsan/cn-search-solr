From here, you can also see down the Champs-Élysées and all the way to La Défense, a major business district in Paris. The best time to visit is when the sun is starting to set over the city. If you’re really lucky, you'll see the Eiffel Tower sparkle for the first time that evening.\n\n__Address__: Place Charles de Gaulle, 75008 Paris  \n__Métro stop__: Charles de Gaulle Etoile (line: 1, 2 and 6)",

Take in a 360-degree view from the 56th floor; and if you dare, continue up to the terrace, which is the highest viewing platform in Paris. \n\n__Address__: 33 Avenue du Maine, 75015 Paris   \n__Métro stop__: Montparnasse–Bienvenüe (line: 4, 6, 12 and 13)",

Take a seat beneath rose-covered trellises and enjoy a drink or two with the Eiffel Tower looming on the horizon. This terrace is best during warm spring days and the summer (naturally), and it’s always a good idea to make a reservation for the terrace.\n\n__Address__: 17 Avenue Kléber, 75116 Paris (16th arrondissement)  \n__Métro stop__: Kléber (line: 6)",

Come prepared: You’ll have to climb about 387 steps to get to the top of the tower, but from there, you can see all along the Seine, to the Eiffel Tower, and over to Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre. Treat yourself to a few cream puffs at Odette or a warm cappuccino from Coutume Café (at the Finnish Institute) after your workout. \n\n__Address__: Parvis Notre-Dame - Place Jean-Paul II, 75004 Paris  \n__Métro stop__: Saint-Michel/Cité (line: 4)",

As soon as the first twinkle starts, you’ll hear the crowd gasp and cheer while pulling out their phones and cameras to capture the magical moment. It’s free, always open, and accessible to everyone. To warm up frozen fingers and toes afterward, head to Carette for hot chocolate and macarons. \n\n__Address__: Place du Trocadéro et du 11 Novembre, 75116 Paris  \n__Métro stop__: La Tour-Maubourg (line: 6 and 9)",

A picnic on the lawns around the tower’s base is a must once the weather allows it. Bring a bottle of champagne, bread, cheese, and charcuterie and stay until the tower sparkles for the first time that evening. It never gets old.\n\n__Address__: Place Jacques Rueff, 75007 Paris  \n__Métro stop__: École Militaire (line: 8)",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/53db229fdcd5888e145e75c9]|||Virgin America's The Loft at LAX|||\n\nI recently spent an afternoon curled up in a Vitra Alcove day bed, drinking Blueberry VeeV Daiquiris, nibbling on small plates of soba noodles and sushi, and soaking up the panoramic view as day turned to night. No, I was not at some decadent beach bar. I was stranded at LAX. My [travel plans had imploded](http://www.cntraveler.com/perrin-post/2013/09/three-tips-to-avoid-a-missed-flight-nightmare), and I found myself with several hours to kill in Virgin America's Terminal 3 club lounge, [The Loft](http://www.virginamerica.com/vx/lax-loft). Not only were there complimentary tropical cocktails, but there were also many of the comforts of home—including high-speed Wi-Fi, a large-screen TV, even peanut butter, jelly, bread, and a toaster. (And all for an entry fee of $40 if you're flying Virgin America or a partner airline.)\n\n\n\nAs nice as such perks might sound, they actually pale in comparison to what you can find in the finest airport club lounges worldwide. Here are some of the most spoil-you-rotten perks encountered by frequent first-class flier Gary Leff, who writes [View From The Wing](http://boardingarea.com/viewfromthewing/2013/12/07/worlds-best-airport-lounges/), as well as the airport aficionados over at [LoungeBuddy](http://www.loungebuddy.com/), the must-have app for finding the best lounge when you're stuck at the airport.\n\n\n\nThe Thai Airways First Class Lounge in Bangkok gives guests an [hour-long spa treatment](http://boardingarea.com/onemileatatime/2012/04/06/the-last-aeroplan-hurrah-thai-airways-first-class-lounge-spa-bangkok/). \"Nothing can beat an hour-long Thai massage prior to flight,\" says Leff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Lufthansa First Class Terminal in Frankfurt summons Porsches and Mercedeses that [drive you right to your plane](http://crankyflier.com/2011/05/17/the-new-first-class-experience-on-lufthansa/) when your flight is ready to depart. \"Other lounges that provide tarmac transfer, albeit in more limited circumstances, are the Lufthansa first-class lounge on the B concourse in Frankfurt, the Lufthansa first-class lounge in Munich, the Swiss first-class lounge in Zurich, and the Air France first-class lounge in Paris,\" adds Leff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Qatar Airways Premium Terminal in Doha has a [luxury jacuzzi](http://efficientasianman.com/2013/06/12/trip-report-around-the-world-in-100-hours-qatar-airways-first-class-premium-terminal-doha/) and sauna.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The First Class section of Cathay Pacific's \"The Wing\" lounge in Hong Kong has [private \"cabanas\"](http://blog.sleepinginairports.net/2013/03/03/cathay-pacific-first-class-lounge-features-cabanas-and-champagne-bar/) for freshening up. \"They come complete with a bathtub, shower, day bed, and room to get work done,\" says LoungeBuddy co-founder Brent Griffith. There are also 12 luxury shower suites, just in case you don't need a whole cabana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The [SkyTeam Lounge](http://www.jaunted.com/story/2011/4/5/95238/61991/travel/Inside+the+SkyTeam+Lounge+in+Terminal+4+at+London-Heathrow) at Heathrow in London offers an \"oxygen bar.\" You get \"10-minute sessions of pure oxygen,\" says Griffith, \"including a choice of individual flavored scents like citrus or pure air.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The \"F*** Me I'm Famous\" [lounge in Ibiza](http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/ontherecord/2013/06/07/checking-in-at-david-guettas-airport-lounge/), the Spanish island famous for its nightlife and electronic music, was developed by Grammy Award-winning musician David Guetta and has a DJ booth and dance floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Turkish Airlines CIP Lounge in Istanbul has a [billiard table](http://first2board.com/foodwineandmiles/2013/10/03/visiting-turkish-airlines-business-class-lounge-istanbul/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse at London's Heathrow has a [recording studio](http://blog.virgin-atlantic.com/t5/Our-Experience/New-Recording-Studio-at-Virgin-Atlantic-Clubhouse/ba-p/1671#.Uq8mExxZw-0) and digital editing room for music mixing, just in case you dream up a new tune while waiting for a flight and don't want to forget it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Speaking of making music, the [Asiana Business](http://boardingarea.com/frequentlyflying/2013/10/29/lounge-review-asiana-business-class-seoul-incheon-midfield-concourse/) and FirstClass Lounges in Seoul have a piano available for use by \"guests who are aspiring musical virtuosos,\" says Griffith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse at New York's J.F.K. has a Bumble & Bumble [hair salon](http://blog.virgin-atlantic.com/t5/Our-Experience/Virgin-Atlantic-Unveils-New-JFK-Clubhouse/ba-p/1531#.Uq8nwhxZw-0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Korean Air first class lounge in Seoul makes personalized metal luggage tags for its guests upon request. [Here are the ones custom-made for Leff](http://boardingarea.com/viewfromthewing/2012/12/23/suites-treats-and-eats-a-malaysian-mileage-thanksgiving-korean-airlines-first-class-kuala-lumpur-seoul-and-the-korean-airlines-first-class-lounge-seoul/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The United Club at Tokyo's Narita airport has a pretty cool [beer machine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCV9Ha0zCTU).\n\n\n\n**Have you found a better airport lounge perk? I'd love to hear about it. What was it, and where?**\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n**Related:**\n\n\n\n[These New Airport Lounges Can Save the Day](http://www.cntraveler.com/perrin-post/2013/10/these-new-airport-lounges-can-save-the-day-if-you-re-delayed)\n\n\n\n[A Must-Have App for Airport Delays](http://www.cntraveler.com/perrin-post/2013/10/a-must-have-app-for-airport-delays)\n\n\n\n[Virgin Atlantic v.

      "body":"[#image: /photos/547bd4c72a3d21fa285cb2ca]|||\nLima, Peru.\n|||\n\n\nPeru will soon begin construction on its first large-scale national museum. Located southeast of Lima, in the valley of the Lurin River, the museum will serve as the entry point to the Pachacámac ruins, a sanctuary which houses ancient pyramidal temples and squares. The grounds date back to around 200 A.D. and were constructed over the centuries by several different cultures, including the Huari, the Ichma, and the Incas. It will be called the Museo Nacional del Perú (National Museum of Peru).\n\nWhile the ruins will be central to the museum’s focus, contemporary art will also play a major role in the museum’s collection. The 49,000 square foot space will have an estimated 500,000 artifacts, as well as a library, classrooms and laboratories to promote modern science, and the education of the national heritage of Peru. It will also absorb most of the collections of two existing museums: the Museum of the Nation and the Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology, and History of Free People.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/5421c5c8cf292a6830da13c7]||||||\n\n\n\n\nThe museum’s modern design is the vision of Peruvian architect Alexia León Angell, who beat out close to one hundred entrants in a competition hosted by the Peruvian government. Though the museum will be far outside the city center – 25 miles from Lima – it’s been reported that the Ministry of Culture is in talks with the Municipality of Lima to find new and convenient ways for visitors to reach the outlying destination. Hyperallergic [has some renderings](http://hyperallergic.com/177546/at-long-last-peru-gets-a-national-museum/) of what the interior and exterior of the museum will look like.\n\nConstruction on the museum will reportedly begin once archaeological studies are completed sometime this year, with the museum’s full completion expected in April or May of 2016. Though dates are fuzzy as to when one can officially visit, there’s no doubt that this museum’s opening will cause a flurry of excitement the world over for its inventive collaboration between ancient ruins, and modern art.
