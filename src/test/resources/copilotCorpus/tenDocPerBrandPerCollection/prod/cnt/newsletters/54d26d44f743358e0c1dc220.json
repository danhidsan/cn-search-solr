The inner walls of the balconies are painted in sunset shades of red, orange, and purple, while the yellow umbrellas and deck chairs pop against the turquoise water of the Olympic-size pool they surround. Rooms at [The Saguaro](http://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/palm-springs/the-saguaro--palm-springs) are inspired by Mexican art and filled with hand-crafted Mexican furniture. Guests are also encouraged to peruse the art installations on rotation in the hotel's public spaces that feature work by local artists, or to get out and explore the town on one of the brightly painted cruiser bikes available.",

Its vibrant stripped exterior is your first indication that the [MEININGER Hotel](http://www.meininger-hotels.com/en/hotels/berlin/airport/) is a far cry from the earth-toned interiors of many chain business hotels you'll find surrounding airports. The 151 rooms spread throughout its three floors are punctuated with bursts of color that pop against grey walls and white bedding. Common areas like the lounge are filled with royal blue sofas, while colorful murals of landscape photography occupy the walls of the bar and guest kitchen.",

The architecture is inspired by the traditional houses and colors found around the Zaan region, featuring green gables trimmed in white. The hotel's 160 rooms feature relics from the Zaan region's culture and history. While this hotel wears its color on its sleeve, the rooms are far from monochromatic. Murals featuring black and white photography are paired with brightly colored chairs and the Taste Delux room features floor-to-ceiling colored images of vintage advertisements.",

It was originally built in 1875 and recently underwent a [renovation and reopening](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2013-09-22/new-inn-at-john-o-groats-scotland) that saw the addition of several Nordic-style dwellings. The red, yellow, blue, green, and tan facades look all the more vibrant standing in a row beside the white structure that served as the original hotel. The [Inn at John O'Groats](https://www.naturalretreats.com/uk/destinations/scotland/john-ogroats/) has 17 rooms, all of which feature locally-sourced art, including a penthouse apartment inside the turret of the main building, which offers 180 degree views of the coast.",

The hotel, a short distance from the Louvre, was designed by artist Julie Gauthron and features her artwork throughout. The rooms in this \"bohemian chic\" hotel are filled with vibrant vintage and modern pieces of furniture and feature walls coated in purples, blues, and greens. One room even has coloring book-style wallpaper that Gauthron's daughter helped fill in portions of. Gauthron also designed the equally colorful [Crayon Rouge](http://www.hotelcrayonrouge.com/hotel.html), a \"little brother\" hotel to the Hotel Crayon. Both are located in the 1st arrondissement.",

The 59-room boutique hotel was designed by Olivier Hannaert and Michel Penneman in a renovated 1970s low-rise. Each of the seven floors are designated a different color, and rooms feature giant Pantone color swatches that hang as artwork on the walls. The hotel offers guests full color immersion during their stay: Sip coffee from a Pantone mug over the hotel's buffet breakfast, then hop on a Pantone bike and head out to explore Brussels.",

By day, sun umbrellas and the patterned tiles of the hotel pool bathe the patio in green, blue, and pink. By night, the hotel's facade is illuminated in lime green and orange. The 52 rooms are blanketed in color and feature light-box art installations above the beds and translucent furniture in vibrant hues.

It's a mix of vintage and ultramodern: Bedside tables are decorated with working vintage rotary phones, but include QR code instructions on how to use them. The lobby features typewriters ready for writing home, a high-tech media hub with Wii and Wi-Fi, and a vinyl-record listening station.

Rooms at [The Saguaro](http://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/united-states/palm-springs/the-saguaro--palm-springs) are inspired by Mexican art and filled with hand-crafted Mexican furniture.

The hotel's 160 rooms feature relics from the Zaan region's culture and history. While this hotel wears its color on its sleeve, the rooms are far from monochromatic.

The rooms in this \"bohemian chic\" hotel are filled with vibrant vintage and modern pieces of furniture and feature walls coated in purples, blues, and greens.

The 59-room boutique hotel was designed by Olivier Hannaert and Michel Penneman in a renovated 1970s low-rise. Each of the seven floors are designated a different color, and rooms feature giant Pantone color swatches that hang as artwork on the walls. The hotel offers guests full color immersion during their stay: Sip coffee from a Pantone mug over the hotel's buffet breakfast, then hop on a Pantone bike and head out to explore Brussels.",

By day, sun umbrellas and the patterned tiles of the hotel pool bathe the patio in green, blue, and pink. By night, the hotel's facade is illuminated in lime green and orange. The 52 rooms are blanketed in color and feature light-box art installations above the beds and translucent furniture in vibrant hues.

It falls on the seventh day of the seventh month on the lunar calendar (this year, August 20). Its origins spun out of an ancient Chinese folk tale called \"The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd,\" in which a fairy (the weaver girl) falls for a mortal (the cowherd), which angers her mother, who just happens to be the goddess of heaven. Her mother separates them, but the pair are eventually allowed to reunite once a year on—you guessed it—the seventh day of the seventh month.",

Boys would chase the girl they liked, and simply catching and kissing her would announce their engagement to the village.

The actual reasons behind the day are murky, but time has turned his actual story into a (familiar) tale of a hero who slayed a dragon in order to save a princess. \n\nSt. Jordi's Day is especially popular in Barcelona and the Catalonia region, and celebrated on April 23. The tradition of men giving women roses is believed to have started in the middle ages, but in more recent times women also give men books for an interesting twist. The origins of the latter are less murky (and fanciful), but sprung out of the fact that since William Shakespeare also died on Apr. 23, the traditions of rose and book giving were combined.\n\n \n\n\n\n ",

The ruins of her church still stand on Llanddwyn Island, off the coast of North Wales.

We recommend hiking up the sea cliff to Piazza Bovio, where you can enjoy views of the harbor and all the way to Elba Island—home to some of [Italy’s prettiest secret beaches](http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/2014/07/skip-capri-go-here-instead).",

It’s also home to two Spanish lookout towers from the same time period, which offer unbeatable vistas of the port. More a foodie than a history buff?

So why aren’t you there already, sipping a glass of prosecco and watching the sun set over the Italian Riviera? The sleepy, colorful port town still remains the summer getaway of choice by wealthy Milanese and Turinese, but it doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy the luxe life, too—if only temporarily. Unlike the narrow, tourist-congested streets of nearby Portofino, Camogli has quiet, open piazzas and nature paths that will lead you up to some spectacular coastal views.\n",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/53dab561dcd5888e145c7093]|||\nYou'll want to go here.\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nBut why let Kayak have all the fun? We went one further, analyzing [their analysis](http://www.kayak.com/travelhacker) to make these predictions that should help you travel smarter—and save money—in 2015.\n\n__Deals will determine destinations__\n\nTravelers suddenly fell in love with Milan in 2014, Kayak said, with the city's share of click traffic growing by an almost unbelievable 105 percent year over year. Airfares, though, have fallen an average of 13 percent, leading Kayak to declare the city the number one deal destination for 2015. (The October 2013 launch of [Emirates service from New York’s John F. Kennedy International to Milan](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2013-04-09/emirates-airlines-launches-new-york-milan-service-october-040913) no doubt helped keep prices low.) With the Italian city hosting the World Expo from May through October, look for it to attract even more travelers this year. In addition to Milan, Hyderabad, Toronto, and Savannah appeared both on Kayak’s list of trending places *and* its list of best deal destinations. In general, travelers should monitor new airline routes as a source for deals on airfare. One good place to keep track of new options is [Airfarewatchdog](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-08-18/airfarewatchdog-com-s-tips-on-getting-the-best-airfare-deals).\n\n__The ingredients will be local, the diners not so much__\n\nFive of Kayak's [top ten trending destinations](http://www.kayak.com/travelhacker/trending)—Portland (third), Toronto (sixth), Savannah (seventh), Nashville (eighth), and Montreal (tenth)—are top North American cities for food. Joining a wealth of homegrown talent, established superstar chefs have expanded their empires to most of those cities in recent years as well, with David Chang now overseeing five Momofuku restaurants in Toronto, Hugh Acheson launching The Florence in Savannah, and Sean Brock bringing Husk to Nashville. As Americans' obsession with food continues to grow, so too will this trend. Keep tabs on emerging culinary destinations and make your travel plans—and restaurant reservations—*before* that up-and-coming chef ends up drawing national attention as a finalist on “Top Chef.\"\n\n__The best time to buy airfare to Europe is yesterday__\n\nKayak suggests booking flights to Europe *six months* in advance to get the lowest airfare, a considerable change from [their advice last year](https://www.kayak.com/news/2014-kayak-travel-guide-everything-need-know-save/) to book only eight to ten weeks in advance. [As *Condé Nast Traveler* reported last week](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-01-29/airfares-arent-actually-dropping-heres-why), a strong dollar is making European travel more desirable for Americans—at least once they get there. With airfares to Europe likely as high this summer as they were last year, deals, particularly at the last minute, will be scarce. If you do feel the sudden need to flee the United States, head to the Caribbean instead of Europe: You'll find the best prices just two to four weeks in advance, according to Kayak.\n\n__The most popular destinations in 2015 will be the most popular destinations of 2014 (and of 2013 and of 2012 and...)__\n\nYou can probably guess the ten most popular domestic destinations of the year: New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Orlando, Denver, Washington D.C., Seattle, and Boston. Kayak’s findings here are nearly identical to [every](http://www.hotel-price-index.com/2013/fall/american-travel-habits/top-locations-for-americans.html) [other](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-07-27-most-visited-US-cities-forbes_N.htm)  [recent list](http://consumertraveler.com/today/forbes-lists-top-10-most-visited-u-s-cities/) of the most popular places to go. One way to find a deal in these perennial favorites? Average airfares to most of these cities spike in the summer months, so simply visit in at a different time of year.\n\n__And airfare to those popular destinations will rise in July__\n\nThe most expensive month to fly to nine of Kayak's ten most popular cities was July. (The lone exception was Orlando, where December sees the highest fares.) If you’re flying to one of those cities this summer, Kayak's data suggests that June or August will see lower ticket prices.\n\n__Beachgoers will keep it boring__\n\nInterest in beach destinations this year will be as predictable as the rise and fall of the tide. Grenada, [Kayak’s top trending beach destination](http://www.kayak.com/travelhacker/beach/saint-lucia), saw a respectable increase in click share of 31 percent. Other \"trending\" destinations saw little change, though. Searches for Saint Lucia were up just eight percent; Saint Martin saw interest gain only three points. In other words, beach bums are not changing it up when it comes to where they relax.\n\n__This summer will be the best time to visit Rio de Janeiro__\n\nRio de Janeiro saw the second greatest increase in interest from travelers compared to the previous year, up 49 percent. Related: from June 15 to July 13, 2014, it hosted seven World Cup matches, including the thrilling final. (The median airfare cost to Rio de Janeiro during June and July—typically the city’s offseason—was 28 percent higher than in May and August.) Expect a similar surge in interest and cost in August 2016 when the city hosts the Summer Olympics. If you are more interested in the city itself than a sporting event, this summer should make for a great opportunity to see [the very best of Rio](http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-02-25/photos-rio-de-janeiro).",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/53daa87f6dec627b149f9971]||||||\n\n** You can't leave Tokyo without eating…**\n\n\n\n Soba (buckwheat noodles). In fact, you'll have a tough time leaving Japan without eating it at least once. Order a tempura lunch set (and you will, every day), and your tray comes piled high with cold, snappy noodles. Tokyo is sweltering and humid come summer, but a plate of chilled soba, often served with ice cubes mixed in, is the next best thing to climbing into the ice cream freezer at 7-Eleven.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**How to eat it**: Do not wear a white shirt. Your soba will be delivered to the table on a _zaru_ (bamboo tray), often with _nori_ (dried seaweed) sprinkled on top. Next to it will be a small cup of _tsuyu_ (a cold broth made from dried bonito flakes and soy sauce), an empty cup, a saucer with wasabi, and finely chopped _negi_ (scallion). Mix the tsuyu, wasabi, and negi in the cup; if you aren't used to spicy, go easy on the wasabi. If you're congested, it will clear you right up. Deftly use your chopsticks to pick up some soba noodles and then dip—don’t drown—your soba in the tsuyu. Lean over, open wide, and slurp heartily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you’ve nearly finished your soba, the waitstaff will bring over what looks like a lacquer teapot. It’s actually water from the pot in which the noodles where cooked. Hardcore soba lovers will pour it into their remaining tsuyu and drink it like soup.\n\n\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/53daa87fdcd5888e145c34a9]||||||\n\n**How to order**: Like so many Japanese foods, this one is easy to order because its English name is Japanese. The menu will likely be in Japanese. Soba is often served as part of set meals, but if you want to order it a la carte, ask for \"_zaru soba, onegai shimasu_\" (“cold soba, please”). As soba broth is fish based, strict vegetarians will want to substitute soy sauce. Don't complicate things by trying to pantomime swapping soba broth for soy sauce, though; the soy sauce will already be on the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**How to pay**: The bill will be set discretely on your table after your order is relayed to the kitchen, but in the world's most polite country, this is in no way an attempt to rush you out of the restaurant. When you're ready to leave, just go to the cashier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Do you tip?** Tipping is not customary in Japan. If you leave money on the table, the waitstaff will try to give it back to you. Your polite thank you's throughout the meal are enough.\n\n\n\n**Etiquette tip**: Leaning over your bowl and slurping the soba noisily is perfectly acceptable. You should inhale with gusto to cool down the noodles on their way from the plate to your mouth. Try not to cut the noodles with your teeth, and be careful not to let them slip from your mouth and splash back into the bowl. Do not douse your entire tray of soba with soy sauce; this is what the empty cup is for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**More travel etiquette**:\n\n\n\n[The One Dish You Should Never Order in Rome](http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/2014/05/the-best-food-in-rome)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[What Not to Do in Las Vegas](http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/2013/12/what-not-to-do-in-las-vegas)\n\n\n\n[What Not to Do in New York City](http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/new-york/2013/12/what-not-to-do-nyc-travel)\n\n\n\n_Sophie Friedman is a manager with [Context Travel walking tours](http://www.cntraveler.com/travel-tips/travel-specialists/paul-bennett), a company chosen as one of [Condé Nast Traveler's top travel specialists](http://www.cntraveler.com/travel-tips/travel-specialists)._",
