Today there are plenty of places to see live music in D.C., including legendary venues like Bohemian Caverns, where Miles Davis and John Coltrane once played; the 9:30 Club has hosted everyone from Arcade Fire to Rob Zombie. D.C.'s museums are also filled with music history: The National Museum of American History, for instance, has old cassettes and other pop-culture ephemera in its collection.  \n\n**Places to go:** [The 9:30 Club](http://www.930.com/) (pictured); [John F.

It's known as an incubator for country acts, even leading to ABC's _Nashville, _ a TV series inspired by the city's music history.

Permanent exhibits look at the musical history of the Midwest and Cleveland itself, spotlighting artists like Kid Cudi and Pere Ubu, as well as DJ Alan Freed, who allegedly coined the phrase rock & roll. Hey, like the song says—Cleveland rocks.  \n\n**Places to go:** [Rock & Roll Hall of Fame](http://www.rockhall.com/)  ",

The easy-to-hike **Rim Trail **from Kolb Studio to Maricopa Point allows a moment of solitude at dawn or sunset.\n\n\n\n4. The small but excellent **Tusayan Museum**, just south of Desert View Drive, exhibits 4,000-year-old artifacts.\n\n\n\n5. **Navajo Point** is 24 miles from Grand Canyon Village, but go for the stellar views, particularly at sunrise and sunset. At 7,498 feet above sea level, it’s the highest spot along the South Rim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Read on for more [National Park Views Not to Be Missed.](http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/2012/03/national-parks-views-photos-yellowstone)**",

      "body":"Whether you’re off for business or pleasure, traveling can be a stressful thing if you’re not properly prepared. When it comes to packing for your trip, your actual wardrobe will naturally vary depending on your destination. But when it comes to what to wear and bring onto the plane, I’ve come to adopt a basic uniform that has alleviated any pre-flight anxiety. This is geared specifically for guys, but aside from the clothing, the rest is totally applicable to the ladies as well. Here’s what I always have on my carry-on:\n\n[#image: /photos/540f97ea17e4b1f634eefa2c]||||||\n\n1) If you’re only going on a short trip (1–3 days), I’ve found this multifunctional bag by Qwstion to be the perfect solution. It's not too big, not too small, and fits with ease in the overhead compartment. It comes with an attached padded sleeve inside for a 15-inch laptop or tablet, and it even includes a separate shoe bag. The best part is this bag not only acts as a duffle, but it can also convert to a backpack as well. *[QWSTION](http://www.qwstion.com/us/bags/weekender-washed-black.html), $310*.\n\n2) In addition to the carry-on bag, I also bring a small tote that has a shoulder strap. It's just convenient to have another bag where you can throw magazines, snacks, a tablet, etc. This L.L. Bean Field Canvas tote is great because it's not too wide and has a zipper so everything stays inside when you throw it underneath the seat in front of you. You don’t have to fuss with any buckles or straps. *[L.L. Bean](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/81519?feat=677-GN1&page=field-canvas-tote-bag), $89*.\n\nWhen it comes to my travel outfit, I usually stick with solids and monochromatic/dark colors. Solids are preferable because they don’t leave as strong a visual impression as something with a print, and that’s helpful when you want to minimize what you bring and re-wear certain pieces. \n\n\n3) A black or white T-shirt is a perfect base layer. You can never go wrong if you start with the basics.  \n*[RVCA](https://www.rvca.com/shop/product/mens-t-shirts/truck-patch?color=BLK), $27*.\n\n4) Layering is key when it comes to travel. While a simple tee is my most comfortable go-to, I like to layer a long-sleeve, light blue button-down shirt on top. It works well in just about any circumstance. *[Quiksilver](http://www.quiksilver.com/allman-long-sleeve-shirt/qukuseqywt03030#selectedColor=bmc0&type=5), $49.50*.\n\n5) You never know the climate conditions in airplanes and airports, so a lightweight jacket is always a good idea. This jacket by COS is a perfect example: It’s thin, made of a durable technical fabric, and walks a perfect fine line between casual (but not too casual) and just a bit fashion forward. *[COS](http://www.cosstores.com/us/Shop/Men/Coats_Jackets/Technical_zip-up_jacket/46909-15229657.1#c-15153035), $125*.\n\n6) I prefer traveling in a nice broken-in pair of jeans, but ones that don't have holes, are too distressed, or have a light colored wash. Jeans are about as classic as it gets—as with the shirt mentioned above, you can easily dress them up depending on what you pair them with. *[Old Navy](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=55506&vid=1&pid=776324022), $29.50*.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/540f9808ade04e4d09bbc0fb]||||||\n\n\n7) This is optional, but I also like to throw a very lightweight zip-up hoodie into my bag. These fold down really easily, don’t take up much space, and layer well underneath a jacket. In times when it suddenly gets super cold and windy, or if it’s raining and you didn’t pack an umbrella, an extra hoodie can be a lifesaver. *[J.Crew](https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/teesfleece/Tops/PRDOVR~86607/86607.jsp?srcCode=PINT00003), $78*.\n\n8)  I think most of us dread going through the security line, and although some airports no longer require you to take off your shoes, most still do. Slip-on shoes are the best solution. They are also good because your feet tend to expand once you're 30,000 feet in the air, and slip-ons will expand with them. *[Vans](http://www.vans.com/shop/perf-leather-slip-on-shoes), $60*.\n\n9) For some reason, I have the unfortunate luck of always ending next to the row with the screaming child or loud talker. That's why noise-canceling headphones are a godsend. They might be expensive, but they are well worth the investment for the bit of solace and sanity on every flight. I like these earbuds from Bose—they are less bulky but still as powerful as a full-sized pair. *[Bose QuietComfort 20i](http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/index.jsp), $299.95*.\n\n10) There’s nothing worse than reaching for your phone or tablet and seeing your battery indicator in the red. It’s a good idea to bring an extra battery charger. This one by Fluxmob can double as your wall charger (so that’s one less thing to bring) and converts to an extra on-the-go battery charger. Just remember to pack the original cable your phone or tablet came with. *[Fluxmob](http://www.fluxmob.com/products/bolt-argon), $59.99*.\n\n11) After being on the plane for a few hours, the constant recycled air can wreak havoc on your skin. These individually wrapped face wipes are an easy way to stay refreshed and look sharp right out of the gate. *[Ursa Major (box of 20)](http://www.ursamajorvt.com/products/essential-face-wipes), $24*.\n\n12) I like to throw an immune system supplement and a couple bags of ginger or peppermint tea into my carry-on. With all the weird things you’re exposed to in airplanes and airports, its just nice to have a little healthy backup. Just in case. *[Emergen-C (box of 30)](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias=aps&field%20keywords=emergen%20c&sprefix=emergen%20c,aps&rh=i:aps,k:emergen%20c) Emergen-C (box of 30), $12.69*.\n\n13) Finally, if nothing else, a good pair of shades is *essential*. You are an international jet-setting man of mystery, after all—right, Mr. Bond? *[Westward Leaning](http://westwardleaning.com/products/color-revolution-9-22-blue-mirror-wayfarer), $210*.",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/54cfe2989abb8d533165d3d2]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s more romantic than whisking someone away to an island retreat and then proposing? Very little, which is why the staff at the [Westin Hilton Head](http://www.westinhiltonheadisland.com/) in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, employs “engagement concierges” whose job is to help facilitate proposals—whether that means sourcing the perfect flowers, choosing the right restaurant, or getting \"bystanders\" in on the surprise. *Condé Nast Traveler* spoke with Ellen Lam, the hotel's leisure sales manager, who oversees the engagement concierge program, to get the dirt on what it takes to pull off the perfect proposal.\n\n__First things first—when someone asks you to help with their proposal, what does that usually entail?__\n\nSometimes [the request for help] happens in advance when the couple makes the reservation. One of them will usually reach out to us and let us know what they're planning and look for ideas that we can provide them. But sometimes it's spur of the moment, and we have to find jewelers on the island. The planning that happens in advance is more about the *where*—where are the most romantic spots, the best tables at restaurants, that kind of thing. \n\nOnce they get here, we get involved in the *what*: Where can we hide the ring, what place will have the fewest people. We get into the nuts and bolts of what's going to happen. We have four or five restaurants here on the island that we really recommend because not only do they have the right ambiance but the management is fun to work with and in tune with orchestrating these kinds of happenings.\n\n__Why do you think Hilton Head is such a popular proposal spot? Is it just the appeal of being on the beach and getting away from it all?__\n\nWe have a unique ambiance here on Hilton Head. It's hard to think of a resort that has so resisted the siren call of development. There are no neon lights or streetlights, no commercial signage over five feet or buildings taller than the trees. As part of that, we want people to enjoy the unique scenes we have here. It's a beautiful, unspoiled environment.\n\n__Have you had any unusual or difficult requests?__\n\nThe most unusual one we've had was a guest who asked us to hide the ring in an oyster shell, on an oyster bank, in the creek. That was major stress to make sure this thing was well handled. We partner with a local adventure company called [Outside Hilton Head](http://www.outsidehiltonhead.com/), so we reached out to them and they were able to tell us when the tides were on the day he wanted to propose, since that made a big difference. They went out in advance and placed the ring in the oyster on the oyster bank, then the couple had a guided kayak tour and [the guide] took them to the oyster bank, and there were dolphins playing around them, and the guide was in on it and encouraged the woman to reach out and pick up the oyster. It actually went off beautifully. We were trying to get a drone to videotape it!\n\nWe had a woman say no! It was not good because the engagement concierge did not know the outcome, just where it was and the backdrop. She called the guy the next morning to make sure it all went according to plan, and obviously he was very emotional about it. The guy wanted to have people in the water on stand up paddleboards as a backdrop for the photo, so we arranged all of that, and then she said no.\n\n__What if a couple gets engaged on the property without asking someone from the hotel to be involved? Is there anything special you can do for them?__\n\nWe had an LGBT couple here get engaged in October. We have a package where if you buy three rooms you get a suite for one of them so everybody has a place to hang out. We had a group of guys here for a getaway, and they had an oceanfront cabana they had rented. They did the proposal out there—they called room service to get champagne, so that's how we found out about it, and we sent it up for free. \n\n__About how many proposals happen at the resort?__\n\n[Our outgoing concierge] was in the job for a year, and she had 34 proposals she had worked on and helped plan in her first year of the program. Our restaurant director, who is kind of a young, gregarious, fun-loving guy, has been involved in a number of other ones where people come to, say, our oceanfront bar and let the server know that they might need a bottle of champagne. The server lets Freddy, our RD, know, and he engages with the guy (or girl!) and sees if there's anything special they can do.",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/53dac1ca6dec627b14a00920]|||\nWould you book a hotel room for just four hours?\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n[HotelsByDay](https://www.hotelsbyday.com/), a service that claims to be the first to allow travelers to instantly book mid-day rather than overnight hotel stays, launches today. The startup offers morning, mid-day, or afternoon stays of four to eight hours at 40 different hotels in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. The company plans to add Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Miami, and other cities soon.\n\nHotelsByDay says it's targeting travelers looking for a quiet place to work, nap, or refresh, as well as locals looking for a getaway in their home city. It could also appeal to business people who prefer a quiet room to a coffee shop, travelers who crave a shower upon landing, or people wanting to take advantage of a hotel’s fitness facilities. To me, it sounded like a good option to leave behind the distractions of my D.C.-area home and get some work done. So when HotelsByDay offered a preview ahead of the launch, I accepted.\n\nUsing the HotelsByDay website will be familiar to anyone who's booked a room online. So far, though, the only Washington, D.C. accommodation available is at the Capitol Skyline Hotel, which I booked. In a location where more options are available—most of the current offerings are in Chicago and New York—travelers can browse them all by location, time available, cost, and amenities. Rooms are for two guests, and check-out time is not flexible, which is no surprise given the nature of the service. (While none of the participating hotels are giving rewards points for intra-day stays yet, HotelsByDay is looking to partner with hoteliers in that area.)\n\nMy five-hour intra-day stay was $90 before tax. That was also the lowest rate I was able to find online for an overnight stay at the Capitol Skyline Hotel, checking in the night before my visit. On my stay, I was able to use the room from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.; had I spent the night, checkout time would've been noon. Some people may prefer the quiet of a hotel room to alternatives like simply working in a local coffee shop, but the cost of a $90 room compared to a $3 coffee may limit the appeal of HotelsByDay to those with flexible expense accounts.",
