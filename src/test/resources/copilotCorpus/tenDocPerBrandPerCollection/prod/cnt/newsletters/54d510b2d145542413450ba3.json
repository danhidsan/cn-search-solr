From pirates to prostitutes (aren't they synonymous?) the city has weathered its fair share of drama—thanks to everything from Gabriel García Márquez's remarkable novels of \"magical realism\" to the less-than-palatable shenanigans of U.S. Secret Service agents in 2012. Tips: Don't take a carriage ride through town, and avoid very late night stumbles through San Diego and Centro. Do, however, explore the up-and-coming Getsemaní neighborhood for its raucous Wednesday-night parties and interesting graffiti art. The chic Viceroy hotel group may deliver a new bolt-hole soon in a converted convent.*—David Jefferys*",

From pirates to prostitutes (aren't they synonymous?) the city has weathered its fair share of drama—thanks to everything from Gabriel García Márquez's remarkable novels of \"magical realism\" to the less-than-palatable shenanigans of U.S. Secret Service agents in 2012. Tips: Don't take a carriage ride through town, and avoid very late night stumbles through San Diego and Centro. Do, however, explore the up-and-coming Getsemaní neighborhood for its raucous Wednesday-night parties and interesting graffiti art. The chic Viceroy hotel group may deliver a new bolt-hole soon in a converted convent.*—David Jefferys*",

The formal hiking program takes full advantage of the terrain; other options include watsu, acupuncture, hot river-stone massage, and craniosacral therapy. Built in Spanish colonial–style, red-brick casitas with tile roofs and outdoor patios are set amid extensive gardens. “This is one of my favorite places to rest, relax, and revitalize.” “Staff are helpful and friendly.” “Fantastic meals” are included in the rate—the locally sourced cuisine is primarily vegetarian. “It’s the best place to regain your health—physical and mental.” There’s a one-week",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/54d3fae6d14554241344fae8]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nFLYR recently launched [a fare prediction tool](http://beta.getflyr.com/#/) that gives users advice on whether to buy a ticket now or wait for a better price. Unlike the many airfare forecasters that have come before, FLYR says its predictions are based on data specific to the flight in question—not just on average fares for a particular route and day.\n\nThat novel approach gives the service an accuracy rate of more than 80 percent, according to FLYR senior content strategist Andrew Jing. To make its predictions, FLYR’s algorithm considers previous airfare patterns and \"historical trends from millions of unique cases,\" he says. While Jing declined to say how FLYR obtains that data, he did say that \"we are constantly running backtests on all of our predictions,” to improve the site's functionality.\n\nHere's how it works: After searching FLYR for a particular departure, travelers can select a \"Predictions\" button to see the 24-hour fare forecast, along with the probability of a future fare change or flight sell-out. By selecting a \"FareBeacon\" button, users can opt in to email notifications that track specific flights. FLYR directs users to partner sites for the actual booking of seats.\n\nAt present, FLYR tracks more than 1,900 domestic routes—though information on Southwest and many American Airlines flights is not available—and it looks as far as 120 days in advance. The start-up plans on adding select European flights in April with other international routes coming mid-year. Also coming soon is FareKeep, a pay service that will let \"users to lock in a price prior to actually purchasing the fare outright,” Jing says.\n\nBut FLYR isn't alone in its quest to use flight-level data to inform airfare predictions. [A recently released iOS app from Hopper](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-01-28/morning-news-a-new-app-from-hopper-promises-to-predict-the-future-of-airfares) makes its own calls about future prices, and it provides guidance on the best travel dates and alternate airports that may have cheaper flights. Hopper says *its* accuracy rate is 95 percent. An Android version is planned, and Hopper is adding some of the app's predictive features to [its website](http://www.hopper.com/).\n\nMore airfare data—and more competition to parse that data—should help consumers make more informed choices in the long run. But with more and more forecasters becoming available, it may soon be hard to figure out which one to use. Until a dominant forecaster—or a service that aggregates predictions from multiple forecasters—is available, travelers are left where they started, checking multiple sites before booking to find the best price. Some things, unlike airfares, never change.\n",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/54d3ef10d14554241344f6d3]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable on most international and transcontinental flights, these limited-edition collectibles pay tribute to the eight carriers that American Airlines has gobbled up, as well as the airline's own old logo ( [which many fliers were sad to lose](http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/new-american-airlines-logo-triggers-ire-and-sense-d-j-vu-146659)).\n\nAside from being deliciously vintage, these heritage kits sum up how far American Airlines has come from being a [consolidation of scrappy regional carriers](http://www.aa.com/i18n/amrcorp/corporateInformation/facts/history.jsp) to the world's largest airline. Here's a nostalgic look back some of these gone-but-not-forgotten airlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__AirCal__\n\nThough American Airlines took over the regional carrier based in Orange County in [1987](http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-02/business/fi-1823_1_american-airlines), you can now grab this sun-colored piece of nostalgia almost thirty years later. Its fare from SoCal to San Francisco, by the way, was [under $15 in 1967](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_California). Good luck finding airport parking for that now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__US Airways__\n\nIt feels a bit strange to eulogize an airline whose livery can still be seen, including on its own [branded credit cards that are still being issued](http://www.worldgotbigger.com/). Still, US Airways, once called Allegheny Airlines and USAir, exemplifies how airlines are constantly reincarnated under different brands.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/54d3eec4f743358e0c1de186]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n__TWA__\n\nOne of the greats in aviation history, St. Louis-based Trans World Airlines once served varied routes reaching Tanzania, Bahrain, and other far-flung destinations. The brand's adventurous spirit lives on through the [handsome, still-futuristic JFK terminal](http://gothamist.com/2014/10/14/ohny_twa_terminal.php#photo-1) that was designed by Eero Saarinen.\n\n__America West__\n\nLike many second (or third or fourth) marriages, US Airways is bringing its own set of stepchildren to its union with American. Arizona-based America West took over US Airways in 2005 and opted to forgo its own branding. Now with American Airlines initiative, you can have an amenities kit bearing America West's unique, landscape-inspired logo.",

When weather, or anything else out of an airline’s control, causes a delay or cancellation, for the most part its only obligation is to get you to your final destination at its earliest opportunity on its own planes. It may take other steps, but that would be as a courtesy and not a requirement.\n\nWhile trying to regroup and reschedule, you might become frustrated and tired, perhaps even livid if your airline is unhelpful and uncommunicative. I understand. I’ve had to [put myself on pause](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-01-02/the-ombudsmans-travel-new-years-resolution-count-to-five) in the past. If your flights were disrupted in the last few weeks, I hope your airline did its best to inform and reschedule you. My other hope is that you were able to be reasonable throughout the tumult. Remember, gate agents and flight crews do not cause the delays. Treat them with respect and you’ll be more likely to get the same in return. Besides, even if the agents aren’t handling the disruption well, yelling and demanding is not likely to help you get on a plane any sooner. These [tips from Brett Snyder](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-01-09/stranded-at-the-airport-tips?), on the other hand, could help your cause.\n\nLet’s talk about why airlines don’t owe you anything if there’s a weather delay. First, strictly from a rational perspective, airlines can’t control the weather or the dictates of air traffic control. When they can’t fly their planes, it throws their system out of whack and costs them money. Would it really make sense for them to provide hotel rooms, give food vouchers, and offer compensation every time a plane is delayed or cancelled due to the weather? I imagine ticket prices would go up considerably.\n\nThen there’s the reality of their contracts of carriage. As an example, let’s look at an excerpt of [Virgin America’s](https://www.virginamerica.com/cms/dam/vx-pdf/contract-of-carriage.pdf). Why Virgin America? Because it is consistently rated as one of the best domestic airlines, but you’ll see that even it will not reimburse you for consequential expenses, nor is it obligated to offer compensation for reasons outside its control:\n\n*“__Schedules and Operations:__ Virgin America will endeavor to carry Guests and their baggage with reasonable dispatch; however, times shown in timetables, advertisements, or elsewhere are not guaranteed and form no part of this Contract of Carriage. … Schedules are subject to change without notice. Virgin America is not responsible for or liable for failure to make connections, or to operate any flight according to schedule… Under no circumstances shall Virgin America be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive or special damages including, without limitation, damages for lost revenue or profits, loss of use, lost wages, or business interruption arising from the foregoing.\"* \n\n*“Force Majeure: In the event of any Force Majeure event, Virgin America may, without notice, cancel, terminate, divert, postpone or delay any flight or the right of carriage or reservation of traffic accommodations without liability except to issue an involuntary refund. …”* \n\nThat seems clear enough. Let me clarify something else. This is not an apologia for the airlines. Sometimes they don’t deliver compensation even [when it’s due](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-08-13/quick-fix-getting-bumped-from-a-flight), or they are astoundingly opaque when all you want is a simple answer. I also don’t want to demonize them— there are times when they do everything they can to help. I offer this information because I want you to avoid unnecessary frustration. We receive many letters from readers regarding delays and cancellations. Unless you’re convinced the airline could have avoided the flight irregularity and you have evidence to back it up, don’t expect to receive compensation or much sympathy. Better to use the time and energy to plan your next trip, rather than write to the airline in what is most likely a futile attempt to gain satisfaction.\n\n*Have a travel question you want answered?

              "bio":"Eric is also an actor and screenwriter, which has limited his ability to travel as much as he would like. He has still managed to visit 48 states (Alaska and Kentucky, he’s coming), France, Italy (for dinner), the UK, Canada, Mexico, The Bahamas, Australia, and New Zealand, so far his favorite destination. Along with the temperate climate, the big mountains and the vividly blue waters, it’s probably because New Zealand is tied with Denmark as the least corrupt nation in the world, something he appreciates after 12 years as mediator on the Ombudsman column. During that time, Eric has read thousands of letters from readers who encountered problems on land, sea, and in the sky. He’s learned that no matter how well you plan, you always need to be ready to improvise. He thinks there’s nothing better than an unplanned day in an unexplored place, particularly if it involves time in the water or on the snow.",
