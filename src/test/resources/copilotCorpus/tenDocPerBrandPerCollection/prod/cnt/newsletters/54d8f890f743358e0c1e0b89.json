Pizza bianca contains neither of pizza’s two traditional toppings—cheese and tomato sauce—and instead features thin dough drizzled with olive oil and coarse salt, which is then baked and sliced before serving. Fun fact: It's frequently [sold by weight](http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-10-03/7-things-you-never-knew-about-rome/4), not by slice. ",

The first pizzeria in the U.S., Lombardi's, opened on Spring Street in New York’s Little Italy in 1905, and it didn't take long for other *pizzaiolos*—Grimaldi's, Patsy's, Di Fara—to follow suit. The hallmark of New York–style pizza is its thin, crispy, hand-tossed crust (coal-fired is traditional, but wood and gas have been used too), topped with a light tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese.

Toppings (which often include meat) and cheese are then layered under a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago has a lot of contenders in the race for best slice, but a few of the city’s most famous establishments include [Lou Malnati's](http://www.loumalnatis.com/), [Uno](http://www.unos.com/), and [Gino's East](http://www.ginoseast.com/).",

It’s layered or mixed and fried in batter, then topped with an egg and okonomiyaki sauce, which tastes like a sweeter version of Worcestershire sauce.

It welcomes flights from London Stansted via Ryanair. \n\n__When to visit:__ July and August is high summer, when you should be guaranteed good weather. July is the better month, as August is when most Italians are on holiday so the beaches will be busiest. June and September are quieter months, but you can still enjoy warm days then.\n\n__What to wear:__ Women parade the beaches in elegant swimsuits paired with wide-brimmed straw hats and large sunglasses. For men, the uniform is almost strictly Speedos. \n\n__What to read:__ *[A Room With a View](http://www.amazon.com/Room-View-E-M-Forster/dp/1482694573/ref=la_B004N8Z5NM_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1412893619&sr=1-1)* by E. M Forster (1908). The book's heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, rejects her Victorian upbringing and falls in love while on holiday in Italy. It's a classic novel that is both romantic and funny, all while inspiring you to live *la dolce vita*.",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/53fb3624a5a7650f3959d073]|||\nAn array of fashion finds at S*uce|||\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can you likely find us doing between photo shoots and meetings and dinners? Why, shopping, of course! Over the past handful of years, we've mastered the art of making any city a shopping destination. Trust us—where there's a will, there's a way (especially when that will has to do with burning through our credit card limits).\n\nWhen in Dubai, which is essentially a very expensive amusement park for the 18+ crowd, no will is necessary. In fact, you should actually use your willpower to stay *away* from the shops (if that's even possible), as the pull to pick up an extra suitcase's worth of designer duds is magnetic. Here, find our guide to the best shopping in Dubai—but if you have to pay for heavy baggage fees flying home, don't blame us.\n\n**[S\\*uce](http://shopatsauce.com/)**\n\nHow to best describe S\\*uce? It's kind of like the UAE's version of legendary Parisian concept store [Colette](http://www.colette.fr/), but in multiples—you can find five in Dubai, which go by quirky monikers like S\\*uce in the Hood and S\\*uce on Sea. Picture offbeat tchotchkes and accessories, ranging from bejeweled clutches in the shape of a Fanta can to Bambi figurines to ball caps with plush dinosaurs on the brim. The boutiques also carry healthy helpings of Isabel Marant, Shourouk, Mawi, Isa Arfen, Sacai, and Ek Thongprasert—otherwise known as everything we want to wear right now. And if you're really in a \"surprise me!\" mood, they have a vending machine for presents, which really must be seen to be believed. *(Multiple locations; +971 4 346 3393)*\n\n\n[#image: /photos/53fb362381424d9d655bcb4d]|||\nColorful bags at S*uce's Dubai Mall location|||\n\n\n\n\n\n**[The Gold Souk](http://www.city-of-gold.com/)**\n\nGo to the Gold Souk to get a taste of traditional Middle Eastern shopping. And by traditional, we mean a massive marketplace filled with nothing but gold…on gold on gold on gold. Do as we do and bring along a magpie _Vogue_ editor like Lynn Yeager to guide you through the bartering process. She returned to the stall selling her prized buy three times before she got her desired price. When it comes to these trinkets, it's all in the negotiation. *(Al Sabkha Road, Al Dhagaya)*\n\n**[Mahani](http://www.mahanifashion.com/)**\n\nThis avant-garde concept store carries enough insider-y labels to keep even the most discerning fashion snob flipping through their racks. Rodarte, Simone Rocha, J.W. Anderson, and Junya Watanabe are all well represented. Think of this store as the artsy antidote to Dubai's flash (without losing any of the luxury factor). *(The Boulevard, Jumeirah Emirates Towers; +971 4 351 4812)*\n\n\n[#image: /photos/53fb3624a5a7650f3959d072]|||\nLevel Shoe District at the Dubai Mall|||\n\n\n\n\n\n**[Level Shoe District](http://www.levelshoedistrict.com/)**\n\nThis shoe store puts all major department store shoe floors to shame. Stock up on rare Alaïa and Altuzarra stilettos and then disappear under a pile of shoeboxes in the Prada, Dior, and Louis Vuitton boutiques—when we visited, we kind of felt like we were the fashion-girl equivalents of \"Keep 'em coming\" bar patrons. But be warned: It's much harder to find space for shoes in already overstuffed bags than it is for clothes. *(The Dubai Mall; +971 4 501 6888)*\n\n**[Symphony](http://bysymphony.com/)**\n\nSymphony is the place to go for the full look: Chalayan jacket with Jason Wu blouse with Frame Denim jeans with Alexander McQueen skull-bedecked stilettos. And then throw in a Marchesa gown for good measure. Why not? Dubai is all about excess, and that shouldn't stop at shopping. When in, uh, Rome, right? *(The Dubai Mall; +971 0 4 330 8050)*\n\n\n[#image: /photos/53fb3623a5a7650f3959d063]|||\nThe Chanel boutique at Level Shoe District|||",

While this makes it tempting to throw on some sweatpants, there are other options that will keep you looking nice and comfortable, and help you avoid having to make a long pit stop at your hotel upon arrival.

I tend to stick to classic pieces with a neutral color palette. It’s a pretty fool-proof way to not look like a tourist everywhere you go. \n_____\nEquipment Brett Silk Blouse *([shopbop.com](http://www.shopbop.com/brett-blouse-equipment/vp/v=1/845524441901731.htm?folderID=2534374302168584&fm=other-shopbysize-viewall&colorId=12867); $198)*\n\nMadewell Skinny Skinny Jeans *([madewell.com](https://www.madewell.com/madewell_category/DENIMBAR/PRDOVR~B0574/B0574.jsp); $115)*",

Your face and hair are the first things to get messed up during your flight—you will be sleeping (or trying to), after all. The best way to prepare for is to pick a style that won’t look bad if it gets a bit tousled. I usually use this as an excuse to wear a hat. Not only will I not have to worry about packing it, but it’s also an easy way to cover up crazy plane hair. As for your makeup, try and keep it light. You can always touch up before your descent. \n_____\nRag & Bone Wide Brim Fedora *([shopbop.com](http://www.shopbop.com/wide-brim-fedora-rag-bone/vp/v=1/1571419729.htm?folderID=2534374302164858&fm=other-viewall&colorId=12560); $195)*",

I usually limit myself to a small tote, which gives me a limit to how much I can carry and also helps me avoid the whole looking-like-a-tourist thing.

I usually end up wearing my everyday jewelry, such as a few rings, a watch, and necklaces—pieces that tend to go with anything.\n_____\nDaniel Wellington Classic Sheffield Watch *([danielwellington.com](http://www.danielwellington.com/us/classic-sheffield-209); $199)*",

But in legendarily flat Kansas, it's barely a hill. You won't need harnesses and pitons to get to the top of \"Mount\" Sunflower, in Western Kansas. At its summit, you'll be towering above the entire state—but you probably won't even notice. \n\n\n[#iframe: https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d6348206.957607!2d-102.03724439999999!3d39.02191860000001!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x870b607a03decb49%3A0x3fa549ae39b46d47!2sMt+Sunflower%2C+Weskan%2C+KS+67762!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1423178166548](600x450)||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n__Kansas isn't as flat as you think.__\n\nIn a 2003 study published in the Annals of Improbable Research, a trio of geographers used a 1:250,000-scale digital model of Kansas to mathematically prove that the state is, as is often said, flatter than a pancake. But that doesn't mean the pancake is a perfectly horizontal one. In fact, it's tipped gradually but consistently upward toward the High Plains, gaining over 3,000 feet in elevation from the southeast to the northwest.\n\n__One state's high point is another state's lowest.__\n\nAs a result, Kansas's highest point is in Wallace County, just a ten-minute walk from the Colorado state line. But the dizzying heights of upper Kansas are nothing once you get to into Colorado and the foothills of the Rockies. Head sixty miles north along the border and you'll hit the Arikaree River, which is actually the lowest point in the state of Colorado.\n\n__Stop by if you're ever in the middle of nowhere.__\n\nThe highpoint is an hour away from even the tiniest nearby towns, so no one ever stumbles on it accidentally. If you want to visit, you'll have to make your way from Interstate 70 to a state highway to a gravel road, then across a cattle guard onto the dirt roads of a privately owned ranch. Don't worry about trespassing! The Harold family, which has homesteaded here since 1905, welcomes \"hikers\" to Mount Sunflower. \n\n__At least there's an actual sunflower.__\n\nTry not to be disappointed when you drive up to the peak. Mount Sunflower is a barely noticeable rise in the middle of a field. On \"top\" you'll find a sculpture of a sunflower made from railroad spikes, a picnic table, a collection of license plates supplied by visitors, and a mailbox that contains a guest register and a neighborly invitation to stop by the ranch house and tell the Harolds \"about your trails and tribulations to the lofty summit.\" It may not be Everest, but over a thousand weary pilgrims show up every single year.\n\n*Explore the world's oddities every week with [Ken Jennings](http://www.ken-jennings.com/), and check out his book [Maphead ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439167176/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=kenjenninconf-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1439167176) for more geography trivia.*",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/53e2ec15dddaa35c30f6497c]||||||\n\nFor the huge number of Americans who don't live in a big city, flying internationally often means scrambling to make a connecting flight at another airport. It's a high-stress situation, but one that can be avoided if you're smart about planning your trip. Here are three major airports to avoid if you have to make an international connection—you might just save yourself from getting a major headache before that long flight.\n\n\n\n**Chicago: O'Hare International Airport**\n\n\n\nChicago's largest airport has added several runways over the past few years (with one more to come in 2015), leading to fewer delays. Unfortunately, that doesn't change the less-than-ideal terminal setup when it comes to flights abroad. All international arrivals go into Terminal 5, but once you've passed through customs and immigration, you still have to hop a train to make your connection at domestic terminals 1, 2, or 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, it's a little bit easier if you're flying out of O’Hare. All of the international departures for American and United operate from the airport’s domestic terminals (1, 2 and 3), along with some—but not all—of United and American's biggest partner airlines. But if you're connecting from American to British Airways, you'll still have to make the trek to Terminal 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**New York City: John F. Kennedy International Airport**\n\n\n\nIn addition to perennial delays, JFK's terminal structure often leads to headaches for international travelers. The airport has six distinct buildings, only two of which are connected behind security; and with four (soon to be five) customs facilities, navigating can get confusing quickly. Let's say you're flying on JetBlue, one of JFK's airline hubs, and arrive at Terminal 4; you have to go through customs and immigration before taking the AirTrain to Terminal 5 for a domestic connection. (JetBlue passengers will soon get a reprieve: In the coming months, the airline will open its own customs facility in Terminal 5, making for an easier trek.)\n\n\n\nJFK's other large airline hub is Delta, and the situation there is also a pain. International flights arrive at Terminal 4 but many domestic flights operate out of Terminal 2; to get from one to the other, you have to take a ride on the \"JFK Jitney,\" a bus connecting the terminals. (At least it's behind security.) An even bigger problem is connecting to partner airlines such as Air France and Alitalia, which are in a totally different terminal from Delta. The same goes for American and British Airways. If you absolutely _must_ connect at JFK, give yourself plenty of time between flights.\n\n\n\n**Los Angeles: LAX**\n\n\n\nTravelers have long grumbled about the difficult connecting situation at LAX. The airport has no fewer than eight distinct terminals and few are connected behind security. Each domestic airline is located in its own terminal (some even have flights leaving from multiple terminals), while most international airlines operate from either Terminal 2 or the Tom Bradley International Terminal. That can mean long walks or waiting for a bus to take you around the loop, as well as an additional security check-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, the situation will improve in the next few years: The Bradley Terminal is currently undergoing a big modernization project, scheduled for completion in 2019. One of the improvements being made is an easier connection between the international hub and Terminal 4, where American is located. That should help speed Oneworld Alliance connections, but Delta and United will still be far from their partners.\n\n\n\n**Related CNTraveler.com stories:**\n\n\n\n[Flights to Hawaii and JFK's T5i: The First of Many Changes for JetBlue](http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/2012/06/jet-blue-new-jfk-airport-terminal-t5i-hawaii-060512)\n\n\n\n[Smart Tips for Avoiding a Missed-Flight Nightmare](http://www.cntraveler.com/perrin-post/2013/09/three-tips-to-avoid-a-missed-flight-nightmare)\n\n\n\n[The Art of the Airport Layover](http://www.cntraveler.com/perrin-post/2009/09/airport-layover)",
