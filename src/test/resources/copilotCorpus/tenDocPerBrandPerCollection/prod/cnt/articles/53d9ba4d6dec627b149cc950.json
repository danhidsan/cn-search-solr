A daytime pedestrian-only zone, the narrow street runs for a mile between the stone gates of Bab Al Futuh and Bab Zuwayla, past the gold, copper, abaya, and shisha-pipe souks, as well as 34 registered monuments reflecting thousands of years of Islamic architecture. Browse the antiques stores across from the just-restored mausoleum of the Mamluk sultan Qalawun for colonial-era paintings, Arabic-letter typewriters, enamel signs, and other bric-a-brac. Many shops are closed Sundays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1. ** [NAGADA](http://nagada.net)** Cairo-based designers Sylva Nasralla and Michel Pastore transform hand-loomed Egyptian textiles into a versatile mix of sheath dresses, shawls, slinky tops, and trousers—conservative enough for daytime sightseeing in Islamic districts, yet stylish enough for a night on the town. The original line drew inspiration from the galabiya, the Egyptian farmer’s wide-sleeved gown; the duo’s recent travels through rural Asia inspired their latest collection of lightweight, easily packable clothes that translate well in other locales. The boutique, in a 1930s villa in Dokki, also sells home textiles and pottery from the Fayoum Oasis (13 Refa’a St.; 20-2-748-6663).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1. **[TOWNHOUSE GALLERY](http://thetownhousegallery.com)** No matter what exhibit is up at Cairo’s most cutting-edge contemporary art space, occupying a nineteenth-century downtown villa and a neighboring high-ceilinged converted garage, the gift shop always has something interesting and locally made. You might find anything from revolution-inspired paintings by emerging artists to Etsy-esque jewelry made of recycled dice from Egyptian board games. The shop also carries hard-to-find books about Middle Eastern contemporary art. The staff are artists and happy to converse in English about the cultural and political scene (Corner of Hussein El Me’mar and Mahmoud Basyouni Sts.; 20-2-2576-8086).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1. **[AZZA FAHMY](http://azzafahmy.com)** Fahmy, a collector and historian of Egyptian jewelry, trained alongside craftsmen in the Khan Al-Khalili bazaar to learn traditional methods. Inspired by old filigree work and tribal silver from Egypt’s oases, she works passages of Arabic calligraphy into her own signature silver and gold pieces. Fahmy is also one of the rare Egyptian designers with a global impact (Rihanna is a fan), producing accessories for London-based Preen and other designer labels. Of several Cairo branches, the boutique at the First Mall has the largest selection (35 Giza St., second floor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1. **AL QAHIRA** On the second floor of a residential apartment building in Zamalek, this home accessories boutique sells lightweight, easily portable objects unavailable in the tourist bazaars. Wooden boxes inlaid with Ottoman florals or Arabic script; hand mirrors and handbags imprinted with vintage movie star photos; textiles hand-printed with Arabic calligraphy and sold by the yard; and enamel silver jewelry by Cairo designer Suzy Al Masry can all be found here. The shop’s canvas carryall bag, printed with “Al Qahira” (“The Victorious,” Cairo’s nickname) in Arabic, is a cult item in its own right (6 Bahgat Ali St.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Courtesy of Azza Fahmy",
