  "body":"[#image: /photos/53d9ba43dcd5888e14597222]|||A lesson at Mario Surf School in Todos Santos|||\n\n\n\n\n## _Condé Nast Traveler_ Contributing Editor Ondine Cohane tells us her favorite things to do in Cabo San Lucas\n\n## \n1. **[Surf Lesson](http://mariosurfschool.com)** This coast is blessed with some of Mexico’s best breaks especially around Todos Santos to the north. In addition to spots like Los Cerritos and San Pedrito, with its huge rollers, instructor Mario Becerril can take you to places even more off the radar—he has been living here for over a decade—while helping you hone your technique. Whether a newbie who wants to stand up on a board for the first time or an up and coming surf aficionado, Becerril has just the right surfside manner. (Tel.: 52-1-612-142-6156; one-hour surf lesson $60).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1. **[Whale watching](http://www.whalewatchcabo.com)** I have seen whales breach (the graceful move that brings their considerable bulk out of the ocean) in this part of Mexico more than a dozen times and yet each time I see it, it seems like a miracle. From December to April a huge population of whales (over 20 species) come to the waters near Cabo, and pregnant females and their youngsters frolic right offshore. For an even closer look (most hotels offer whale watching boat excursions that are quite informative and intimate) book a tour with Whale Watch Cabo with English-speaking biologists who study the mammals in the region. (Cabo San Lucas Marina, Tel.: 52-624-105-1004; from $75 per person, online advance tickets from $65).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1. **[Wine Tasting Guadalupe Valley](http://baja.com/)** Baja might not be somewhere you associate with good wine but in fact this valley near Ensenada, is one of the world’s up and coming boutique regions. Plan an excursion that includes the excellent vineyards of [Casa de Piedra](http://www.vinoscasadepiedra.com) and Vena Cava, with its cutting edge tasting room. Book a room at the new eco chic [Hotel Endémico](http://www.grupohabita.mx) for gorgeous views over the valley post tastings. And if you happen to be in town during August, the fiesta of the Vendimia (the harvest time for the grapes) includes wine tastings, artisanal products, and multi course meals showcasing the Baja Med cuisine of the area, a spot that Anthony Bourdain is calling “like Napa, only better.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1. **[Deep Sea Fishing](http://www.piscessportfishing.com/)** Looking to catch marlin, dorado, tuna and sailfish? Or just like the Hemingway-like activity of chasing fish for the day, a cool cerveza in hand (the esteemed American scribe did, in fact, fish in these same waters). Home to some of the world’s best fishing championships, the region is legendary for the diversity and size of the catch—an 850 pound Blue Marlin was caught here in 2009. But even first timers can enjoy an outing into the deep blue yonder. Pisces Sportfishing is among the most reputed of the outfitters, and I particularly like the fact that they have a conservation program (set up with crews from La Paz who tag and study local species) and that they encourage clients to throw back fish they don’t plan on eating. (Cabo Maritime Center Marina, Tel : 52-624-143-1288)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1. ** [Beaches](http://www.cabosanlucasbeaches.com)** Don’t ever go swimming by yourself on a deserted beach. This was the good advice given to me by local friends and it is an essential aspect of the beaches on this coast known for their unexpected riptides and sudden swells. But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t a ton of gorgeous beaches to enjoy. Around the main town of Cabo San Lucas, Costa Azul is a pretty stretch and right by Zippers, the restaurant where I like to go for a beer and guacamole as soon as I get off the plane, El Estero has a beautiful estuary that’s great for bird watching and has a chilled out vibe, and Lover’s Beach (behind the area’s iconic arch) has excellent snorkeling, a romantic vibe and can only be reached by water taxi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Courtesy Mario Surf School",
