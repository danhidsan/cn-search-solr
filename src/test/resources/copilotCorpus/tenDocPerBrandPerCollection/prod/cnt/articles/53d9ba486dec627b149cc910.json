The fish of the day (grouper for example) is simply grilled and delicious, and the caramel popcorn and chipotle ice cream is a must. And if I am in the mood for raw fish I go to the sushi bar at Suviche next door and see what sushi chef Nobuo Iwaseya has up his sleeve for that evening. (San Jose del Cabo Tel.: 52-624-146-7000 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n         1. **Café Santa Fé** Café Santa Fé is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the world—and that’s saying something considering that I live in Italy eight months of the year. Owners Ezio Colombo and his former model wife Paula opened the spot in the 1990s after they took a side excursion from Cabo and in many ways the eatery put Todos Santos on the culinary map. My favorite part of the menu is the way it marries local and home country ingredients: lobster in handmade ravioli, tuna carpaccio and sushi, and fresh fish of day with herbs from the owners’ farm and artisanal olive oil. Oh and the margaritas are some of the best south of the border. (Calle Centenario, Tel.: 52-612-145-0340) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1.          **[Restaurant at Rancho Pescadero](http://www.ranchopescadero.com/)** The barefoot chic vibe of this relatively new resort continues at the hotel’s restaurant—where a sun splashed dining area is perfect for whiling away the afternoon (or a moonlit evening) with a crisp bottle of white wine and grilled Baja seafood. Organic fruit and veggies come from the fields on the property and the breakfast burritos are especially good post surf session—you can rent a board for 20 bucks from the hotel. (El Pescadero, Tel.: 52-612-135-5849) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n1.          **[Bar Esquina](http://bahiacabo.com/restaurant.php)** Cabo’s restaurant choices tend to fall into two categories: tucked away resort restaurants that feel almost like being in a private compound or super cheesy spots with “Mexican” bands and sombreros on the walls as the main décor. Bar Esquina is therefore a nice surprise, with a pretty  terrace and heating lamps that feel more LA than Baja, and a menu that includes really good wood oven pizzas—try the mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, prosciutto and arugula combo. The only downside is the spotty service, but while nursing a potent margarita it is isn’t as noticeable. (Playa el Medano, Tel.: 52-624-143-1890) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n         1. **[Flora’s Field Kitchen](http://www.flora-farms.com/)** Don’t get me started on some of the more unfortunate aspects of Cabo’s overdevelopment—this is the desert with limited water and a staggeringly diverse marine coast but it doesn’t seem to stop the building. Which is why the discovery of Flora Farm is particularly gratifying--a ten-acre organic farm that shows that you can have a sustainable business here. Vegetables are all grown on site, meat from the nearby ranch are hormone and antibiotics free, and best of all the food is actually really really good. Beet Carpaccio with fromage blanc, organic fried chicken, and delicious fresh salads are some of the choices but the menu changes according to the season, naturally. And there is also a great grocery store on site where you can pick up all the fixings (fresh bread, cut meats, fruit and cheese) for a beachside picnic.
