          "bio":"Laura Dannen Redman is the digital deputy editor of *Condé Nast Traveler*. When she was three, her dad alleges she sat up in the back seat of the family station wagon, struggling against the seat belt to look out the window, and said, \"I want to see the world!\" Some things never change. She has a decade of international newspaper and magazine experience; most recently, she was deputy editor of *Time Out Singapore* and arts editor of *Seattle Met* magazine, where she won a National City and Regional Magazine Award (CRMA) for Multiplatform Storytelling. Laura is a Princeton grad with a master’s in journalism from Boston University’s College of Communication.",
