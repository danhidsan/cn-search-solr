      "caption":"Norway is halfway through an 18-year plan to spruce up its motorways with roadside overlooks, art installations, and architectural walkways that put American rest stops to shame. It has already built 120 like Steilneset (pictured), which is located in Vardo, at the edge of the Barents Sea in the country’s far north. The result of a collaboration between Pritzker Prize–winning architect Peter Zumthor and the late, great artist Louise Bourgeois, the work commemorates the victims of Vardo’s early-seventeenth-century witch trials. Here, Zumthor’s “forest” of wooden supports is bisected by a long surfboard-shaped structure. Then walk along the rugged coastline and you’ll arrive at a glass-and-steel structure housing Bourgeois’s haunting installation: a schoolhouse chair with flames jetting out of the seat, encircled by a halo of seven giant mirrors. Not all the installations are so somber: Read on for a dreamy drive through the country’s best new lookouts.",

          "caption":"Norway is halfway through an 18-year plan to spruce up its motorways with roadside overlooks, art installations, and architectural walkways that put American rest stops to shame. It has already built 120 like Steilneset (pictured), which is located in Vardo, at the edge of the Barents Sea in the country’s far north. The result of a collaboration between Pritzker Prize–winning architect Peter Zumthor and the late, great artist Louise Bourgeois, the work commemorates the victims of Vardo’s early-seventeenth-century witch trials. Here, Zumthor’s “forest” of wooden supports is bisected by a long surfboard-shaped structure. Then walk along the rugged coastline and you’ll arrive at a glass-and-steel structure housing Bourgeois’s haunting installation: a schoolhouse chair with flames jetting out of the seat, encircled by a halo of seven giant mirrors. Not all the installations are so somber: Read on for a dreamy drive through the country’s best new lookouts.",
