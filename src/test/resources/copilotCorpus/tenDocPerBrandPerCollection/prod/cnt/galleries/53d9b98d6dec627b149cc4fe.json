More than 800 people were killed across the country during the initial 18-day uprising in 2011. Awad, a Muslim, depicted the women unveiled and bare-breasted to demonstrate that Egyptian Islam is not the intolerant Wahabi Islam of Saudi Arabia. The scene is part of a mural he painted with two friends on Mohammed Mahmoud Street, in downtown Cairo, where violence between the military and protesters took place as recently as February",

The rats, the artist says, are Egypt's billionaires, many of whom have fled the country to avoid prosecution for corruption under Mubarak's three decades in power. The silvery figure's sole piece of clothing—a red bra—is a reference to \"Blue Bra Girl,\" the nickname for a veiled Egyptian woman who was stripped and beaten last November by soldiers in Tahrir Square. Civilian journalists caught the moment on video when the activist's abaya was ripped over her head, reviewing a sky blue brassiere, and soldiers stomped on her exposed chest.",

He witnessed men, many of whom appeared to be plainclothes security operatives, attacking female demonstrators. In the following days, the army arrested women trying to prevent the dismantling of protesters' tents in Tahrir Square and subjected detainees to forced \"virginity tests.\" The violation of the bound female figure in this ink drawing, set against a hieroglyphic army of stick wielding figures, is psychological as well as sexual, and the graphic image of penetration references the fact that army snipers deliberately targeted many protesters in the eyes; dozens were fully blinded. The artist's post-apocalyptic ink scribbles and slashes on a \"canvas\" of torn cardboard boxes reflects his personal experience of \"conflicts, bad news and deterioration.\"",
