I’m sitting at a communal picnic table in the backyard of an 1860s Italianate house, eating what must be one of the most exquisite wood-fired pizzas west of the Hudson. The crust is sourdough, thin, chewy, and salted in a way that makes me wonder what exactly I’ve been doing wrong with salt all this time, and it’s topped with lemon-marinated fennel, feta cheese, and fresh parsley. It tastes like a garden. A guitarist and drummer are playing pleasant instrumental music in a corner of the yard, while families at other picnic tables clink wine glasses under crisscrossing strings of glowing lights. It seems impossible that a pizza this remarkable was baked in a no-stoplight town. But more to the point, it seems impossible that a spot this rural and remote-feeling should exist three and a half hours by car from my home in New York City.\n\nThe restaurant is called Table on Ten, and it’s a café, inn, and something of a hub for the farmers and artists who populate the area, which is Delaware County, just west of the Hudson Valley. New Yorkers like to say that Upstate New York is the new Hamptons, but the towns most often associated with that pronouncement are the ones along the river and the Amtrak line: Cold Spring, Garrison, Rhinebeck, Woodstock, and\nof course Hudson, which with its strip of antiques stores and upscale restaurants feels increasingly like a satellite of Brooklyn. In more than  one sense, Delaware County is somewhere else. \n\nIt’s in the Western Catskills, to the north of the Catskills Forest Preserve, and perhaps because it was never properly part of the Borscht Belt—the chain of Jewish summer resort towns of the 1920s through the 1970s—it still feels like the 19th century. Its villages are small\nand spread out, and there’s no clear center. These virtues, along with low real estate prices, have in recent years attracted New Yorkers of a certain stripe and, over time, made permanent residents of them. This was the case with the couple behind Table on Ten, Inez Valk-Kempthorne and Justus Kempthorne, a former model and woodworker, respectively, who first visited Delaware County in the mid-aughts\nand by 2010 had relocated from Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \n\n“We had a small community of friends who decided to buy inexpensive land here and build cabins,” Inez says. “That’s how we got up here. And at some point it was just kind of our turn.” Once their own cabin was built, Inez says, “the question came up: What are we going to\ndo next?” The answer for them, and for an increasing number of other city transplants, was to open a business. And it’s this growing crop of outposts—mainly in the towns of Bovina, Andes, and Delhi, which are about ten miles from one another—that is turning this once off-the-grid\nbucolic corner of the Catskills into an on-the-grid bucolic destination. \n\nTo get here you turn off I-87 near Kingston and head west on Route 28, but rather than stop in Woodstock, you keep going, past Phoenicia and Big Indian to Belleayre Mountain, where the valley opens onto rolling meadows and the real farmland starts. On my trip up, the first super moon of the year was rising behind the mountains, casting a gold light on the green fields and deciduous trees below. Somewhere near the county line, the temperature began to drop, and by the time I reached Highway 10, from which Table on Ten takes its name, the air was a full ten degrees cooler than it had been an hour before. If you didn’t know what to look for, you might breeze right by the inn and perhaps through all of Bloomville without knowing you’d missed anything. This is true of many of the spots worth seeking out in Delaware County, making a long weekend here feel a bit like a scavenger hunt.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/542975254ef7052d36d2bccb]|||\nPhotos: Inside Table on Ten \n|||\n\n\n\n\nThe idea for Table on Ten was hatched as a way to combine Inez’s cooking with Justus’s carpentry. At the 28-seat restaurant and in the three guest rooms upstairs, his woodworking is on display: picnic tables, custom beds, and shelving built with rough-sawn hemlock from nearby mills. Inez designs the menu around whatever is in season at the local farms. The salad lineup involves fresh-picked mizuna, mibuna, mustard, oakleaf, frisée, sylvetta, and purslane leaves, all subtly dressed. For breakfast, she bakes eggs from Last Harvest Farm in a skillet with marinara and fresh basil, and the house-made granola comes with local honey and Cowbella Farm’s maple yogurt. To go with it, there’s a fresh rhubarb and mint soda I won’t soon forget. On pizza nights, which happen every Friday and Saturday, pies are baked in a brick oven built by Justus and topped with unexpected combinations like fingerling potatoes with caramelized cipollini onions and goat cheese;  chocolate shavings, ricotta, honey, and Maldon sea salt; and tomato sauce, mascarpone, prosciutto, Parmesan, and arugula.\n\nIt’s the kind of food that brings people together, as evidenced by the full parking lot—visitors from the city, locals from around the county, and weekenders who own houses in the area. “I think of this place as my home and my city apartment as my pad,” says one such weekender, a nutritionist named Jeanette Bronée, pulling out her iPhone to show me snaps of her Scandinavian-style cabin in the neighboring town of Bovina. “It’s a creative bubble in a way that’s really special,” she says of the community. “There are lots of photographers in the area, lots of people from the art world. But here it’s all about being together, eating together, and being outside. We don’t talk about work. We talk about human things.”\n\nThe food does double duty as an advertisement for the local farms, many of which maintain small stands for the public, offering up their yield on the honor system. Driving around to hit the farm stands—there are scores of them—is what visitors come here to do. fresh eggs, says one sign on Highway 10; heirloom tomatoes, says the next. At Burnett Farms, in Bovina, guests follow the custom of the country and weigh their kale, chard, cucumbers, and scapes before leaving their money in a little wooden box next to the scale. The specialties of the nearby Bovina Valley Farm are Alderney cheese and maple syrup made by owner Dan Finn in a sugar shack on his property. Dan grew up in the area and worked in film for 15 years before returning to his hometown about a decade ago. “At first I was a weekender,” he says, looking every bit the farmer in railroad-striped overalls. “By 2002 I was up here full-time.”\n\nDriving around, I began to get the feeling that the differences between these parts and other, more well-known destinations in the Catskills run deeper than the landscape. In Woodstock, where I have a cabin, it can often seem that there are two economies—one for the locals and one for the weekenders. The man who delivers firewood, say, will have two sets of prices. I’d heard from people who own cabins in Delaware County that the coexistence here was more integrated, and the honor-system arrangement of the farm stands gives this impression. I had to wonder if the reason for this is that people who buy homes in Delaware County tend to move here altogether: put down roots, start businesses, and invest in the community in ways that do more than just increase property values. The area is far enough away that people who really need to be within striking distance of the city, who can drive two hours to a second home but maybe not three and a half, seem not to buy here in large numbers. So there isn’t the same mass of people—a brunching mass, dressed in black and glued to their phones—parachuting in on Friday nights and out on Sunday afternoons. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/54297574425f183f61bf719d]|||\nA moment of silence on the Delaware River.\n|||\n\n\nHolley and Richard Giles, owners of the [Lucky Dog Farm Store](http://cnt.conde.io/restaurants/hamden/lucky-dog-cafe-and-farm-store), an institution in the town of Hamden, lived in Brooklyn for years—she working as a copywriter for a small publisher, he developing film at a photographic agency—and first started visiting Delaware County on weekends. “Originally we were going to do it slowly, just coming up whenever we could, but very quickly we decided to move altogether,” Holley says. They established a farm, then a farm store and café. (Inez worked at the Lucky Dog Cafe before opening Table on Ten, incidentally.) The Gileses also opened the Hamden Inn across the street, offering four modest yet comfortable rooms. But as with everyone else here, it seems, their focus is on the food. When Holley isn’t working on her own farm, she works with a local cheesemaker, not far from where another recently transplanted couple are making apple cider in the town of Walton, which also happens to be where a woman named Cheryl Lins is distilling some very popular absinthe (it’s carriedat the influential Astor Wines & Spirits in Manhattan). “There are more and more food  enterprises springing up everywhere,” Holley says.\n\nOne particularly noteworthy newcomer opened in downtown Bovina in May. Called [Brushland Eating House](http://cntraveler.com/restaurants/bovina-center/brushland-eating-house), it was started by—you guessed it—a young couple from Brooklyn, Sohail Zandi and Sara Elbert. He used to work at Prime Meats, she at sister restaurant [Frankies 457](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-09-23/how-the-franks-do-sicily). They had been to the region only a few times when they found the building that now houses Brushland. “We fell in love with the area right away, and we thought, we have to end up in this place in the long term,” Sohail says. “And then the long term became the short term. My ten-year plan happened in, like, 18 months.” The two serve a simple menu for brunch, lunch, and dinner—dishes like crushed beets with horseradish, hand-rolled pasta, and a one-flip burger with “fancy sauce.”\nAnd true to the Delaware County formula, they also offer lodgings upstairs, in the form of a homey two-bedroom apartment. \n\nWhile there are the usual outdoorsy things to do here—hiking, fishing, horseback riding—it is also, somewhat counterintuitively, a compelling place to shop. The country stores and secondhand shops in each village have a wonderfully eclectic selection. Table on Ten carries the Maldon sea salt used on its pizzas, magnificent beeswax candles from local candlemaker Susan Riesen, and the simple, stylish wares of ceramicist Kelli Cain, whose nearby studio can be visited by appointment. And the area’s many antiques stores are overflowing\nwith moderately priced gems, especially in the town of Andes: There are three alone near the corner of Main Street and Delaware Avenue. \n\nThe most well known of the bunch is Kabinett & Kammer, whose owner, a painter named Sean Scherer, bought an 1840s Cape-style  farmhouse on 90 acres in Walton in 2002. Brooke Alderson, an antiques dealer in Andes who lives nearby with her husband, Peter Schjeldahl,\nthe art critic for *The New Yorker,* convinced Sean to open his shop, which carries utilitarian furniture, vintage photographs, taxidermy, and glamorously quirky objets d’art. “I’ve always been interested in the 19th century, and Delaware County hasn’t changed much in a couple hundred years,” Sean says. “Two friends visited from the city for the first time this weekend, and they both said the same thing: ‘I had no idea this was here.’ ”\n\n\n----------\n\n\n##Stay\n__[Table on Ten:](http://www.cntraveler.com/restaurants/bloomville/table-on-ten)__ Farm-to-table restaurant with three airy guest rooms upstairs. *(52030 Main St., Bloomville; (607) 643-6509; [tableonten.com](http://tableonten.com); doubles from $115; pizzas from $12.)*\n\n##Eat\n__[Brushland Eating House:](http://cntraveler.com/restaurants/bovina-center/brushland-eating-house)__ Newcomer serving simple seasonal fare. *(1927 County Hwy. 6, Bovina; (607) 832-4861; [brushlandeatinghouse.com](http://brushlandeatinghouse.com); entrées from $5.)*\n\n__[Lucky Dog Cafe and Farm Store:](http://cntraveler.com/restaurants/hamden/lucky-dog-cafe-and-farm-store)__ Café and shop centered around local goods and ingredients from its farm. *(35796 Main St., Hamden; (607) 746- 8383; [luckydogorganic.com](http://luckydogorganic.com); entrées from $5.)*\n\n__Russell’s:__ General store and canteen that serves great breakfast. *(2099 Main St., Bovina; (607) 832-4242; russellsstore.com.)*\n\n__Two Old Tarts:__ Popular bakery and lunch spot. *(22 Lee Lane, Andes; 845-676-3300; [twooldtarts.com](http://www.twooldtarts.com).)*\n\n##Shop\n__Kabinett & Kammer:__ Gorgeous vintage finds from Sean Scherer. *(7 Main St., Andes; (845) 676-4242; [kabinettandkammer.com](http://kabinettandkammer.com).)*",
