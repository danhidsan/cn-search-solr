      "body":"[#image: /photos/55f06af14cb36d1b2f0e65ac]|||\nCaviar Kaspia\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nFashion Month (that’s right—four weeks in four cities) is here, and stylists, editors, writers, bloggers, and celebrities from across the globe are packing their (impossibly chic) bags and heading to New York, London, Milan, and Paris to spend a whirlwind 30 days taking in shows, presentations, and parties. But where do they refuel? We asked a few of the fashion world’s tastemakers to give us their picks for the best spots to grab a bite in Paris during fashion week, and they delivered. From Thai food to steak frites, here are a few of their favorites.\n\n##Elie Top, jewelry designer\n“For restaurants I love the poetic and delicious institution that is [La Méditerranée](http://www.la-mediterranee.com/en/)—the wall paintings by Vertes and Berard watch over the intellectuals and artistic types who gather there to socialize. The most Parisian terrace in the city is at the [Café le Nemours](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Nemours/168034883221192), which is near the Comedie Francaise and the entrance of the Palais Royal. If you want to follow in the footsteps of Louis Malle and Serge Gainsbourg, the best bar is the one in the \n\n\n[#hotel: /hotels/53dae7606dec627b14a0a481]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n , off the Arc de Triomphe.”\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f06b21cdd1761348be0aa0]|||\nLa Méditerranée\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n##Isabel Marant, designer\n“\n\n\n[#shop: /shops/548b586d29bcecb31c8d26df]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n is the oldest covered market in the city, and is one of the best spots to eat on a Sunday afternoon.”\n\n##Elizabeth von Guttman, co-founder, System magazine\n“My usual go-to spot is Café de Flore, where you can sit and watch the world go by. It’s great anytime—from breakfast to a drink before dinner. For lunch I love the tiny Italian restaurant [Crudus](http://crudus.wix.com/crudus), which has the most delicious organic dishes. Contrary to many fashion people I love  my pasta! For dinner I go to my usual haunt, [Rose](http://www.yalamai.com/). It’s a Thai restaurant, the food is delicious and the ambiance is always fun and very relaxed, which is needed after running around all day.”\n\n##Aurélie Bidermann, jewelry designer\n“For breakfast, I love to go near to my apartment at the [Café des Beaux Art](http://cafedesbeauxarts.fr/en) in front of the \n\n\n[#activity: /activities/5589e27a3a5d79a77fccf90d]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n near the Pont des Arts. I always order a Parisian breakfast with a latte and a baguette with butter and honey. If I’m at the office during lunchtime, I go to \nthe [Colette Water Bar](http://www.colette.fr/content/menu/la-carte/), it's my canteen.  The waiters are so nice and the food is really good (especially the corned beef hash). For dinner, if I'm with friends, I go to [Le Cherche-Midi](http://www.lecherchemidi.fr/) which is one of my favorite Italian bistros in Paris, or for a special dinner I can’t resist at [L’Arpège](http://www.alain-passard.com/), which is an incredible vegetarian restaurant.  And when I'm with my family, my favorite restaurant is \n\n\n[#restaurant: /restaurants/53eae4d0dd4d6a0b75efc32e]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n—paneling on the walls, white tablecloths—everything is so authentic. It’s THE real Parisian bistro!”\n\n##Miroslava Duma, fashion consultant\n“Can a Russian girl skip dinner at a place that serves as high quality caviar as [Caviar Kaspia](http://www.caviarkaspia.com/fr/)? The answer is NO! But seems like I am not the only one who is totally enchanted by this place. Caviar Kaspia has become the perfect venue for designers/brands and fashion houses for hosting intimate dinners and events. I also love [Derriére](http://www.derriere-resto.com/restaurant/paris/derriere/). I only discovered this place recently, and I have to say every time I go there it still surprises me. The shabby chic decor at this \"apartment style\" restaurant makes it one of the coolest places in Paris, especially during fashion week. And finally, [Castel](http://castelparis.com/). This is the most exclusive and buzzed about club in Paris. As a mother of two and a workaholic, I’m not much of a party girl, but when my invitation says Castel I know I can allow myself to stay a little later.”\n\n\n----------\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55f050494cb36d1b2f0e6368]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/55d4ea9337284fb1079d0352]|||Pistachios grow on a farm in Aegina, Greece.|||\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a child, Petros Petritis would play hide-and-seek with friends in pistachio fields, winding through the rows of short trees and napping under the shade of their dense leaves. Once, in a field where the crop was ripe and ready for harvesting, he picked several nuts and sampled them fresh from the tree. The farm’s octogenarian owner, recalls Petritis, chased after his group of friends and threatened to hit them with his walking stick.  \n\n“You have to remember that pistachios are very important for the local economy,” says Petritis. “Many people make their living or supplement their income by growing and selling them.”\n\nPetritis is right, but pistachios are much more than important, they’re at the very heart of the identity of Aegina, the 34-square-mile island that Petritis calls home. After all, it was here, in 1896, that the Greek cultivation of pistachios began when farmer Nikolao Peroglou planted various nut trees on a plot of land. Nearly every other tree failed in the dry soil, but the pistachio thrived. \n\nFrom that point on, Peroglou devoted himself to the nut: He produced a book in 1916, *The Pistachio Tree,*and gave cuttings from his best trees to other residents on Aegina. The crop eventually spread to the mainland, and led to a rise in annual output that currently tops 11,000 metric tons, making Greece Europe’s leading pistachio producer—and the sixth largest in the world. \n\nBut Aegina pistachios are not just any pistachios. Declared a Protected Designation of Origin product by the European Union in 1996, the fistiki Aeginis are of the rarer koilarati (round) variety and have a pale blonde shell, fuschia-tinged exterior and meat that is emerald when ripe. With a sweeter taste than its American and Iranian counterparts, the Aegina pistachio is traditionally used as a crust for chicken, fish, or feta; soaked in honey and spooned over fresh yogurt; baked into syrupy desserts; ground and stuffed into sausages; or tackled the most basic way: by cracking, shelling, and snacking. \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/5549116a29d479ab28bfa814]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nuts, a local-food purist from Athens told me, don’t need any special treatment or marketing gimmicks—their quality is standalone, and there’s no question of their place in pistachio hierarchy. “We just say that *fistiki Aeginis*are the best,” she said.\n\nCompared with other regions around the world, Aegina has perfect temperature, climate, and soil conditions for growing pistachios. The driest island in the Saronic Gulf, the island has hot summers, mild winters, and a relatively low elevation. The trees thrive in the chalky soils, and breezes from the Aegean Sea help pollinate the trees through wind dispersal: All of these factors contribute to a year-round cultivation cycle with methods that have been in place since the early twentieth century.\n\nDrive through the island’s gently sloped hillsides today, and you’ll inevitably notice orchards of blushing pistachio trees—when the outer shells turn pink, it’s a sign that the nuts are ready. Harvest time typically falls between mid-August and early September. For most, the process is a family affair: All members pitch in to gather and clean the nuts, set them to dry in the sun, and ready them for sale. A festival celebrating the pistachio harvest, the annual [Fistiki Fest]( http://www.aeginafistikifest.gr/?lang=en), draws more than 20,000 attendees, and the nut abounds in all iterations. \n\n“Pistachios are inextricably connected with Aegina,” says Petritis, who last year served as the vice-chairman of the festival’s organizing committee, “and growers make every effort to maintain the quality so as to safeguard a product that is a very important part of the island’s legacy.”\n\n\n__Where to buy:__ Conveniently, the Aegina Pistachio Cooperative, a group of farmers and producers with more than 300 members, sells the nuts raw, baked and salted next to the ticketing booth at the port. Visit Eakion (Dimokratias 18-20) the island’s famous pastry shop, for fistikato, or small pistachio desserts. Behind the town square, To Mikro Megalo (Lada Leonardou 1) sells some of the best local products on island. \n\n__How to get there:__ From Athens’s Piraeus port, take a ferry (Hellenic Seaways Ferries, Nova Ferries, Agios Nektarios Ferry) to Aegina Town, which will take between an hour to 90 minutes and cost approximately $10 for a one-way journey. For a quicker trip, take a Hydrofoil (Hellenic Seaways, Flying Dolphin), which takes approximately 40 minutes and costs about $15 each way.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55a548327772ff921f95ea60]||||||\n\n\n",

But how did this slightly bitter concoction—made of equal parts Campari, sweet vermouth, and gin—go from relative obscurity to headlining every noteworthy drinks list worldwide?\n\nIconic bartender Gary Regan, a Brit who now makes his home in the Hudson Valley, is the go-to man for Negroni history. He recently published *[The Negroni: Drinking to La Dolce Vita](http://www.amazon.com/The-Negroni-Drinking-Dolce-Recipes/dp/1607747790),*which traces the drink back to Florence in 1919. According to reliable lore, the cocktail was born when an Italian bartender responded to a customer's demand for a stiffer riff on an Americano cocktail (a much-tamer mix of Campari, sweet vermouth, and club soda). The patron, Count Camillo Negroni, had picked up a taste for strong liquor while working—true story—as a rodeo clown in the American Wild West, and gave his name to the resulting concoction. Today, Regan estimates that the drink appears on “about 300 percent more cocktail lists than 10 years ago.” One caution for the uninitiated, via [Negroni fan Anthony Bourdain](http://www.maxim.com/entertainment/food-drink/article/anthony-bourdain-tells-maxim-about-most-dangerous-negroni-hes-ever): The drink will “hit you like a freight train after four or five.” \n\nFor almost a century, the Negroni remained a quiet classic, readily offered in Italian restaurants or bars and beloved by cocktail completists. Even in the wake of the cocktail renaissance which was kick-started in the 1990s, [it was still unfamiliar to many stateside](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/06/style/shaken-and-stirred-dressing-italian.html).\n\nIn the last decade, though, the Negroni has morphed into a mainstay of any self-respecting cocktail menu. This ubiquity is due, in large part, to sheer coincidence. The aughts saw a resurgence in two cocktail staples: gin (its cachet renewed via passionate small-batch producers) and bitters (which were pushed beyond Angostura by adventurous barkeeps; in fact, Gary Regan himself launched a much-lauded version, [Regans' Orange Bitters No. 6](http://www.gazregan.com/regans-orange-bitters-no-6/)). This pair of revivals—two out of three of the Negroni's ingredients—prepped drinkers’ tastebuds perfectly.\n\nThe Campari brand seized this opportunity, and in 2009, the Italian firm snapped up the Wild Turkey distillery, the largest acquisition in its history, to expand its U.S. footprint. It then declared 2011 The Year of the Negroni, claiming this as a celebration of the firm’s 150th anniversary (their math seems slightly off, but what’s a year between drinking friends?) Campari ringmastered a showy event that year at industry shindig [Tales of the Cocktail](http://cntrvlr.com/1KInXDP), securing a record for the world’s largest Negroni and embedding the drink in wider cocktail consciousness. \n\nThe Negroni's popularity shows no sign of slowing. Indeed, two years ago the cocktail-industry bible *Imbibe*launched an event in its honor, and the first [Negroni Week](www.negroniweek.com) included 100 U.S. bars mixing up their best versions of the drink. Just two years later, in 2015, Negroni Week had expanded to 3,500 venues in 42 countries. \n\nIts trio of flavors are open to innovation, and the last few years has seen bartenders playfully tweaking the classic recipe to produce signature Negronis of their own. When Portland, Oregon–based bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler experimented with storing a Negroni mixture in oak for a few weeks in 2009, he not only devised the barrel-aged Negroni, now a widespread recipe, but also began to experiment with oaking other concoctions. “We always have two barrel-aged drinks on the menu, and one is always a Negroni. We get tourists coming in specially for that drink—we don’t dare take it off the menu,” he says. Other modern takes on the cocktail include bartender [Charlotte Voisey’s Unusual Negroni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB6rZuZV8Cg) which combines Hendrick’s gin with Aperol and Lillet Blanc.\n\nBut the classic ingredients still have their place as well. “Campari plays a big role in Italian culture—it’s like fish-and-chips for the British,” says Abruzzo-born bartender Mauro Mahjoub who runs a bar in Berlin—Mauro’s Negroni Club—dedicated entirely to the drink. “Everybody remembers the first time they have Campari,” adds Morgenthaler. “It’s the weirdest thing ever—you kinda love it and kinda hate it at the same time, but it’s so intriguing.”\n\nAnd in the Instagram era, the Negroni is a star, its cheery pop of red livening any social media feed and ensuring its popularity will continue to grow. \n\nMore than anything, though, what helped popularize the Negroni is its simplicity. This is a drink almost impossible to snafu:  The only danger, of course, is how easily you can make another one.\n\n__THE WORLD’S BEST NEGRONI-SIPPING SPOTS RIGHT NOW__\n\n##[Mauro’s Negroni Club, Berlin](http://www.negroni-club.de/) \nTry one of Mahjoub’s 15 different riffs on the drink—the bravest should opt for his Negroni Al Volo, which combines Hedrick’s gin, campari and sweet vermouth with absinthe and a splash of tomato juice. “It acts as a catalyst between the ingredients, so it tastes like velvet,” he raves.\n\n##[Clyde Common, Portland, Oregon](http://www.clydecommon.com/)\nIn Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s fiefdom, barrel-aged Negronis are still a mainstay: He mixes up the basic ingredients then stores them for two months in a bourbon whiskey cask.\n\n##[Salvatore’s at the Playboy Club, London](http://salvatore-calabrese.co.uk/contact/salvatores-playboy-club-london/)\nSalvatore Calabrese—the mustachioed cocktail vet dubbed Maestro by his peers—has been making Negronis since he started pouring cocktails as a teen (he’ll celebrate his fiftieth year behind the bar next June). Come here for a classic made by a master.\n\n##[Dante, New York](www.dante-nyc.com)\nAustralians Linden Pride and Naren Young just took over the historic Caffe Dante in Greenwich Village, reopening it as a bar-restaurant with lashings of old country nostalgia. The highlight of the bar list is their 10-strong Negroni menu, offering various delicious riffs on the classic recipe.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55a548330121edec25703138]||||||\n\n",

      "body":"[#image: /photos/55d5d505c47ae13868aea7e9]|||\nAlberto Tasca of Tasca d’Almerita winery, in the heart of Sicilian wine country.\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nFlanked by three oceans—the Ionian, Tyrrhenian, and Mediterranean—it’s little wonder that Italy’s largest island is best known for its beaches. From the [white sand beauties of the north](http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-08-01/italy-s-most-beautiful-beaches) to the pebbly, windswept shores in the south, you’d be easily fooled into thinking that Sicily’s 600-mile coastline is its only draw. But in recent years, visitors have begun to flock to the sun-drenched island for an entirely different reason altogether: wine.\n\nThough wine has been produced in Sicily for millennia, it hasn’t always been good—until the 1990s, Sicilian wine was cheap, mass-produced, and primarily sold off in vats for blending. But then the island underwent a viticultural renaissance: Industrial vineyards were ripped out and replaced with low-yield vines, and a new generation of producers emerged, passionate about highlighting the island’s little-known indigenous grapes. At a time when most Italian wine regions were ramping up production of international varietals like chardonnay and merlot, Sicilian winemakers began turning out small batches of unheard-of wines like zibbibo, catarratto, and frappato.\n\nTheir vision paid off: Today, Sicily has been billed by wine connoisseurs as Italy’s most exciting “new” wine region, boasting about 700 producers cultivating more than 20 kinds of indigenous grapes. Unlike the offerings from Tuscany or Piedmont, Sicily's wine hasn’t quite hit the mainstream quite yet, but that’s where the appeal lies. Sicilian wine country—a gorgeous patchwork of flatlands and plateaux draped in lush vineyards and rimmed by ocean—still feels like a secret, on the verge of being told.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55d5d50537284fb1079d0b6e]|||\nA one-bedroom guest cottage at Planeta winery.\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nSicily doesn't have a designed wine trail, unlike [Sagrantino](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-03-09/why-montefalco-is-italy-best-new-wine-region), [Prosecco](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-07-13/a-guide-to-italy-prosecco-road), or [Franciacorta](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-08-10/italys-best-kept-secret-is-its-sparkling-wine-region-franciacorta); its winemakers are scattered densely across the island. The best way to experience the Sicily's wines is to simply drive, starting in Siracusa and heading clockwise around the island, stopping at *cantine* on or shortly off Routes 115, 186, and 624. \n\nStop first at [Planeta](http://www.planeta.it/en/), a vanguard winery in Noto founded in 1995 by Diego Planeta, the father of “new wave” Sicilian wine. Planeta was so passionate about showcasing the island’s richly diverse terroir that he built not one but six boutique wineries across the island—a different one for each terroir. Here at Buonivini, a sprawling, tangerine-colored estate flanked by 120 acres of planted vines, Planeta makes its flagship Santa Cecilia DOC wine using 100 percent indigenous Nero d’Avola grapes.\n\n“Sicily is full of contrasts, perhaps more than any other wine region,” says Planeta. “We have so many different climates, altitudes, and soils: volcanic soils in the east by Mt. Etna, clay soils in the west, coastal vineyards with sandy soils, and more. That makes for a very diverse range of wines coming out of one island, with very different identities.” \n\nIf you can resist a nap inside Planeta’s cozy, one-bedroom guest cottage, head farther east towards Trapani and stop in at [Valle dell'Acate](http://www.valledellacate.com/). Nestled in the lush hills of Valle del Dirillo, the beautiful stone *cantina*boasts an ancient *palmento*, or pressing room, a nostalgic reminder of how wine used to be made. Tastings take place in an enormous stone barn lined with old oak and chestnut barrels, and are followed by a \"light lunch\" by Sicilian standards: family-style sharing plates of homemade penne al pomodoro, caponata, mozzarella, sliced tomatoes, and sausage, paired with chilled bottles of insolia and chardonnay. (Also highly recommended: Valle dell'Acate's Zagra DOC Sicilia Bianco, a crisp, savory white made from native grillo grapes).\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55d5d508c47ae13868aea807]|||\n\"I drink a bottle of wine a day, with food,\" says Diego Planeta, one of the leading figures behind Sicily's viticultural renaissance. \n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Sicily is best known for its fresh, mineraly whites, the island can turn out some powerful reds, too. Farther north, in the mountainous Sclafani countryside, [Tasca d’Almerita](http://tascadalmerita.it/en/) winery’s Regaleali estate produces seven bold, full-bodied red wines thanks to its high altitude and cool microclimate. Drop in for a bottle of rich, peppery Cygnus, an interesting Nero d’Avola-Cabernet blend, or better yet, stay for a night or two: the estate offers nine beautifully-appointed guest rooms in a 17th-century *palazzo* overlooking a jasmine-filled courtyard. Wine buff or not, you’ll want an extra day just to explore the estate’s 1,000 acres of vineyards and olive groves, or catch a cooking class at Case Vecchie, an estate farmhouse turned cooking school.\n\n“You’re in the heart of Sicily, just two hours from Palermo, but it feels worlds away,” says Alberto Tasca, the CEO and managing director of Tasca d’Almerita (his father, Count Giuseppe Tasca d'Almerita, is the winery’s founder). “It’s a different kind of beauty [up here]—mountains, countryside, grain fields, organic vineyards, olive fields, fruit gardens. It’s paradise.”\n\nAfter your mountain sojourn, had east to Trapani and hop on a puddle jumper bound for Pantelleria, a volcanic outcrop that is Sicily’s largest offshore island. Though it’s just 30 minutes by air, Pantelleria feels like a completely different planet—dry and bleakly rugged, shrouded in low-slung caper bushes, earth-hugging vines, and wild cacti. Even the houses are different: in lieu of stone villas and ancient palazzi, you’ll find only squat, white-domed lava rock houses called *dammusi.* \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55d5d50837284fb1079d0b8c]|||\nLunch with a view: A tomato and basil salad at the Club Levante hotel.\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, the wine here tastes different, too. The island’s hot, dry, windy climate is ideal for producing sweet wine, and that is exactly what it is known for: Passito di Pantelleria, often billed as the best dessert wine in all of Italy. Though there are a handful of good producers on the island, make a beeline for [Donnafugata](http://www.donnafugata.it/)—their Ben Ryé Passito di Pantelleria has a serious cult following. It’s not hard to see why: it's pure liquid gold, warm, sensual and decadent, yet at the same time light and vivacious—Sicily in a glass. \n\nAnd that’s exactly the point, according to Antonio Rallo, president of Donnafugata and the [Sicilia DOC Consortium](http://www.siciliadoc-continentedelvino.com/eng/). More so than any other Italian wine region, Sicilian wines—with their distinctive, sun-kissed nature and sweeping disregard for generic, mass appeal—are a delicious expression of the island’s very essence. They simply sing of terroir. For a visitor, drinking Sicilian wine is not only pleasurable; it serves to deepen one’s understanding of the island, its history, its diversity, and its people. \n\n“Drinking our wine is one of the best ways to truly experience Sicily because it comes from the heart—there’s a bit of Sicily in each sip,” adds Rallo. “Plus, it just tastes good.”\n\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55d5ed85c47ae13868aeaf41]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n",
