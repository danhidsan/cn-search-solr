The entrance is flanked by two massive boulders sourced from the surrounding desert; inside, the atmosphere is stylish and modern, artfully lit and dominated by earth tones. A pool is set to open in 2015, but in the meantime, guests can use the neighboring Mandalay Bay’s artificial beach, complete with wave pool.
