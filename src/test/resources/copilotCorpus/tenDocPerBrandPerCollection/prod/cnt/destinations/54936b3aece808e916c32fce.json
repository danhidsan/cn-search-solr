  "description":"The rapidly growing capital of Texas has always been a haven for independent thinkers. First came the frontiersmen and women. Then the intellectuals of its large state university. Then the hippies. Then the slackers. Then the music scenesters. Then the hipsters. And finally the international companies that were birthed here such as Dell and Whole Foods. Each new group has bought waves if change and a wide liberal streak to this sometimes conservative state. These days, visitors find that what once was a sleepy, leafy college town town with its taco stands and spring-fed swimming pools is a thriving cultural destination. But for all the hype, Austin’s charms don't sit obviously at the surface. We’re here to help suss out the latest hip hidden finds while paying homage to the classic places so undeniably Texan that you’ll be able to understand why the state was once its own republic.\n",

  "dontMiss":"###EAT###\nIf you’re in Austin, then you can’t forget to eat some barbecue, the bloodline of Austin. Everyone knows Franklin Barbecue, even President Barack Obama. Pro-tip: Check out Twitter account @FranklinBBQline to see how bad the wait is for pitmaster Aaron Franklin’s deliciously rich and moist brisket. \n\n##EAT MORE###\n\nIt’s a similar situation over at La Barbecue: the long lines are more manageable, and well worth pitmaster John Lewis’ smoked ribs. Both barbecue trailers account for the time to kill by offering up drinks and occasionally live music. \n\n##FYI###\n\n\n",
