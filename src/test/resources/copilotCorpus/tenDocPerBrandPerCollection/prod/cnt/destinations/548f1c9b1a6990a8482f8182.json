  "description":"It’s easy to fall in love with the fantasy of L.A. Nowhere else—from the newly revitalized downtown to the postcard-perfect beaches of Malibu—has such sunny skies, such insistent glamour. But for all its glossy appeal, this is also a town with substance: an excellent food scene, like the vegan Mexican at Gracias Madre; superior shopping at mainstream retail meccas like The Grove and L.A. institutions [Fred Segal](http://www.cntraveler.com/shops/los-angeles/fred-segal) and Maxfield; and sweeping views of the city from atop Runyon Canyon…all of which combine to make a legendary place even more so.",

She has a decade of international newspaper and magazine experience; most recently, she was deputy editor of *Time Out Singapore* and arts editor of *Seattle Met* magazine, where she won a National City and Regional Magazine Award (CRMA) for Multiplatform Storytelling.
