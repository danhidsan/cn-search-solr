      "body":"[View Slideshow](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/blake-mycoskie-toms-los-angeles-home-slideshow)\n\n\n\n“We are not fancy people,” Blake Mycoskie says. It’s a refrain that comes up often in conversation with the social-entrepreneurship guru and founder of the footwear company [Toms](http://www.toms.com), particularly in regard to the wonderfully \u2028idiosyncratic Los Angeles–area home he shares with his wife, Heather, and their infant son, Summit. The Mycoskies do, however, try to stick to some pretty high standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hanging near their home’s entry is a framed handwritten mission statement that reads: “To live courageous lives, with grace and moderation,” followed by a list of core values, including “Put Family First,” “Be Present,” and “Give Generously.” As Blake explains, “When Summit came along, Heather and I wanted to set up some guideposts for making decisions. We hung them in a very prominent place so that we would remind ourselves every day of what’s important.” He adds, “I’ve started five companies, and each time, I asked the original team to undertake a similar exercise to establish the culture.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Mycoskies’ personal story could not be more perfect if it were invented by the \u2028Toms marketing department. \u2028The pair met five years ago in Montauk, New York, on Long Island’s East End. At the time, Blake was working on the \u2028manuscript of his book *Start Something That Matters.* (Toms, by the way, is shorthand for tomorrow.) He stopped at a surf shop to get wax for \u2028his board and saw Heather working behind the counter. \u2028It wasn’t long before she relocated to L.A. for a job at Toms, where Blake’s pioneering business plan entails matching every product sold (now not only shoes but also coffee, \u2028bags, eyewear, and apparel) with a donation to benefit one of scores of needy international communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fast-forward to 2012, when the couple married in \u2028a tepee on a Utah mountain. Settling in California, the newlyweds initially lived on a 45-foot cabin cruiser anchored in Marina del Rey, a community in Los Angeles County not far from the Toms headquarters in the seaside neighborhood of Venice. They considered building a house on one of Venice’s charming walk streets—as locals call the pedestrian-only thoroughfares—but the allure of open space ultimately drew the Mycoskies to look inland. Eventually they decided to move to Topanga Canyon, that storied redoubt of hippies, artists, and other free spirits. “It’s a place that feels connected to nature,” Heather notes. “The vibe feels like a small town.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n They purchased a 1970s residence, built in a style one might call contemporary barn, set on a one-and-a-half-\u2028acre hillside site with majestic oaks and a gurgling creek. Renovations began, but the couple soon realized that rebuilding and outfitting a home are mighty tasks for people constantly on the go. Around the same time, Heather dropped by [Hammer and Spear](http://hammerandspear.com/), an L.A. home-furnishings emporium and multidisciplinary design studio, and discovered its aesthetic was simpatico with her own. After chatting with the shop’s proprietors, designer Kristan Cunningham and her husband, Scott Jarrell, Heather hired the firm on the spot.\n\n\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55ef261a302ba71f30182e52]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n “The house was already under demolition when we came in, so we had to design it in real time with the construction,” recalls Cunningham. “We were hand-drawing tile patterns as the plumbing was being installed.” Their design choices, she says, were guided by her clients’ already well-developed ideas and predilections. “Blake and Heather wanted everything to feel personal, layered, and evolved—nothing too designery. The biggest challenge was taking all of the amazing objects they’d acquired around the world and combining them in a way that felt truly authentic. The house couldn’t look like a bohemian Colonial Williamsburg.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Working with decorative-finishes specialist [Bruce DeSpain](http://www.despainsdecorativefinishes.com), Cunningham reskinned the interior walls and beams with weathered barn siding and corral fencing, adding a patina of age. “Life is about memories more than things,” Blake says, and thus every room is redolent of stories and experiences and filled with reminders of the couple’s history. The vestibule is paved with reclaimed planks from the Coney Island boardwalk, where Heather’s grandparents met. Treasures from the Mycoskies’ travels include the master bath’s rustic Indian doors, the Balinese desk in Blake’s office, and a massive Buddha statue in the garden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n All those pieces mingle \u2028amicably with vintage finds and custom-made pieces \u2028from Hammer and Spear and \u2028other vendors and fabricators clustered in downtown L.A.’s bustling Arts District. [PSS Design Cult](http://www.pssdc.com), a design/build firm, collaborated on \u2028several elements, including \u2028the kitchen’s hood and brass countertops and the outdoor \u2028shower. Artist and designer Mark James Yamamoto painted the Native American–themed ceiling in the den, while furniture designer [Stephen Kenn](http://www.stephenkenn.com) fashioned the room’s steel-framed sofa and covered it in tent canvas from World War II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The sole disagreement between Cunningham and her clients was related to the playfully outré wedding photograph that graces the entry: Instead of capturing a first dance or a tender exchange of vows, it shows the couple merrily answering nature’s call behind the nuptial tepee. “I thought the picture could be a little more discreet, \u2028but Blake and Heather wanted it front and center,” the designer says. “The image works because it, like everything in the house, speaks to who they are and what they love. It’s 100 percent them.”",
