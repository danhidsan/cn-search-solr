      "body":"[View Slideshow](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/jeremiah-brent-nate-berkus-designed-greenwich-village-home-slideshow)\n\n\n\nFor a certain segment of New York society, having a Fifth Avenue address means one thing: *upper* Fifth Avenue—that gilded corridor lined with gracious limestone edifices overlooking Central Park. But there is another patch of Fifth that has an equal yet quite different cachet. It’s the beautiful stretch just above Washington Square Park, where the avenue begins and the surrounding prewar buildings are prized by those who seek elegance but also cherish the vitality, diversity, and cultural heritage of Greenwich Village. When interior designers [Nate Berkus](http://www.nateberkus.com/) and [Jeremiah Brent](http://www.jeremiahbrent.com/) set out to find a new home, lower Fifth was at the top of their list.\n\n\n\n“This neighborhood, particularly the blocks around West 11th and West 10th streets, has a unique magic,” says Berkus, who rose to fame as Oprah Winfrey’s home-design guru and has since hosted two TV shows (most recently, *American Dream Builders* on NBC last year) while overseeing a busy interiors firm. When he and Brent began dating a few years ago, Berkus was based in New York. Brent and his burgeoning design business, meanwhile, were in Los Angeles. After getting engaged on a Peruvian mountaintop, the pair married last year in front of 220 guests at the New York Public Library. Then, this past March, they celebrated the birth of their daughter, Poppy. Choosing where to center their new lives, they say, was easy.\n\n\n\n“We knew we wanted to have a family and that we wanted to raise our child in New York,” Berkus says. The couple also felt strongly about living in the Village, where Berkus owned a residence ([*Architectural Digest,* November 2012](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/nate-berkus-manhattan-apartment-before-after-renovation-article)). Finding a three-bedroom in a prewar doorman building in this neighborhood, however, can require some luck.\n\n\n\nOne place they saw early in their hunt was a two-bedroom duplex penthouse with a terrace. “We loved the views and the apartment,” Brent recounts, “but it was a strange layout.” Indeed, it sat on the market for months. That’s when good fortune struck: The owner of the one-bedroom next door opted to sell. “We couldn’t stop thinking about the apartment, believing we were meant to live there,” Brent says. “And then, suddenly, we were able to create the home of our dreams.”\n\n\n\nAnyone who has survived a renovation with a significant other knows the stress of navigating the countless decisions. Now imagine both of you are acclaimed decorators with different styles. And yet this is the story of two lives and two visions uniting to achieve something transformative and triumphant. “The energy we discovered working on our home together is unlike anything else,” Brent notes. “It’s totally unfiltered. We do our best work when we are together.” Says Berkus, “I look back and realize that before I met Jeremiah, I had sort of stopped seeing. Being with him and starting to see through his eyes—I was rejuvenated.”\n\n\n\nWhile one wouldn’t exactly call Berkus a maximalist—his focus is on crafting welcoming yet sophisticated interiors—he admits his “instinct as a designer was always to add more to a room. One more piece. One more table. One more object on top of that table. I love to surround myself with furniture and objects—they tell our stories and give us comfort.”\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55ef263d302ba71f30182ef2]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nBrent, by contrast, prefers more pared-down environments. “Until I met Nate the mantra I approached every room with was, ‘Unless a piece is beautiful or functional, get rid of it,’” says Brent, who will take over as host of OWN’s *Home Made Simple* in January. Berkus, he says, opened his mind “to the heritage of design, to why pieces work together and have meaning in a room. He totally shifted my paradigm.”\n\n\n\nIn envisioning their apartment, Berkus and Brent agreed that they didn’t want a sterile design showcase—they wanted a home to live in as a family. “In all of my work, I look at a house and think about the moments that will happen there, the moments we all long to create,” Brent says. “Where will I hold my daughter on Saturday mornings? Where will my husband and I sit and reflect and recharge?”\n\n\n\nFor him, the spot for both of those things is the sun-drenched living room, where a worldly mix of mostly vintage furnishings—roomy 1960s club chairs, a Jansen brass cocktail table with a smoked-glass top, a ’70s sofa seemingly designed for slumping—is inviting as well as stylish. “I love the light,” Brent says of the space. “And being from California, I connect with trees. Which is why I also put a Canary Island dragon tree in the room.”\n\n\n\nBerkus, for his part, is especially fond of the master bedroom, a study in neutrals, with a vintage low table and floor lamps adding softly shimmering brass accents. “It’s the epitome of serenity to me.\n\n\n\n”Something the couple agreed should be a focal point in the home is a handwoven photograph of Joshua Tree National Park by Fernando Bengoechea, Berkus’s former partner who died in the 2004 tsunami that struck Thailand. “That work is central to Nate’s life,” Brent says. “So we put it in the center of our house, Poppy’s playroom.” Adds Berkus, “Everyone should be able to sit in a room with pieces that spark memories. If you create the feeling that a home is a vessel for stories and memories, you have succeeded.”\n\n\n\nThe designers consider their home a great gift. “The day we closed on the apartment,” Brent says, “we were walking through Washington Square, and I told Nate, ‘We have to treasure this.’ For two kids from Minnesota and California to be living in this apartment on lower Fifth? It’s insane. I always wanted to live beautifully, and the idea of Nate and Poppy and me creating a life here together?” He shakes his head in disbelief. Berkus looks at him and says, “Great design is like great love: You trust your gut.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__[Click here to see more of the spirited Greenwich Village home.](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/jeremiah-brent-nate-berkus-designed-greenwich-village-home-slideshow)__  \n  \n[#cneembed: embedjs/550a1c8061646d75b80c0000/video/55ea00ef61646d750600000a.js]||||||",

      "body":"[View Slideshow](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/james-costos-michael-smith-designed-madrid-home-slideshow)\n\n\n\nHanging at the top of the gracefully twisting staircase inside the American ambassador’s residence in Madrid is a painting of a dwarf and his black-and-white dog. A work by John Singer Sargent—after Diego Velázquez—it is one of more than 80 pieces borrowed through the Art in Embassies program by the current U.S. Ambassador to Spain and Andorra, James Costos, and his longtime partner, designer Michael S. Smith. The Sargent marks the passage from the main floor’s public spaces to the private areas upstairs, and quite often guests will find, lying on the carpet beneath the painting, one of the couple’s two rescue dogs, Greco, who bears a notable resemblance to the dog in the 19th-century portrait. The painting can be seen as a symbol of the long history of cultural dialogue between the U.S. and Spain, not to mention a reminder of the consideration that Smith and Costos put into every detail of their comprehensive renovation of the residence. That Greco (named in honor of both the Spanish Old Master El Greco and the ambassador’s Greek ancestry) is allowed to meet visitors is also emblematic of the warm, open, modern style of diplomacy being practiced here.\n\n\n\n“Half the fun of working on the residence is that we get to live in it, and half is that this is part of our legacy to James’s ambassadorship,” says Smith, who dedicated a huge amount of time and significant personal funds to the renovation. The Los Angeles–based designer, who is known for mixing a love of old-world antiques with a casually refined sensibility, emphasizes that this project was truly exceptional. One reason, he notes, is that it has “an expiration date” for him and Costos, whose service will end when President Obama finishes his second term. So the couple, who will be leaving behind numerous furnishings as gifts, aimed to create a flexible setting that would suit future ambassadors.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55ef2634302ba71f30182ec8]|||\nJames Costos and Interior Decorator Michael S. Smith at Home in Spain\n|||\n\n\n\n\n“I might have found this frustrating if I hadn’t done the White House,” explains Smith, who designed the Obamas’ private quarters as well as the Oval Office, and, more recently, updated the White House dining room. “It is a moment in history, and it is a moment that stays.” His intention was for the upstairs guest chambers at the ambassador’s residence to have a distinctly European aesthetic, reminding visitors they are in Madrid. He envisioned the downstairs, meanwhile, as the epitome of classic American decorating, in the vein of Billy Baldwin and Mark Hampton, because that is where most of the Spanish guests are entertained. Take Smith’s favorite space, the living room, which features a blend of antique, vintage modern, and contemporary furniture, with accents ranging from a 12-panel Coromandel screen (once owned by Coco Chanel) to a Philip Guston painting borrowed from American art patron Agnes Gund. Says Smith, “The room is clean and elegant but has weight and scale to it.”\n\n\n\nThroughout the renovation, Smith worked with a State Department design team headed by Jenny Howery-Ford to integrate his own pieces with existing furniture, such as the dining room’s table, which seats up to 30, and vast 19th-century Persian carpet. He also included items sourced in Spain, among them rugs woven in Alicante and pottery from Toledo.\n\n\n\n“I am so proud of Michael’s work at the residence,” says Costos, who was a senior executive at HBO before becoming ambassador. “He’s created a modern platform that embodies the patriotic feeling of an American embassy but is still very much a welcoming home.”\n\n\n\nPerhaps what most gives the residence its distinctive feel is the art. The works installed here represent one of the most extensive Art in Embassies projects ever undertaken. Some pieces came directly from artists, such as Ed Ruscha’s Screaming in Spanish—which hangs in the entrance hall with Robert Rauschenberg’s Bilbao Scraps—and the Glenn Ligon neon work Double America, which glows in the dining room. “We wanted art that highlights America and the connection between Spain and the U.S., and we also targeted pieces by artists who we knew would come and discuss their work,” Smith says. Now Spanish schoolchildren regularly tour the house with a curator or visiting artist.\n\n\n\nCostos has opened up the residence for numerous events, and an invite from the ambassador has become a hot ticket in Madrid. Like the art, however, the entertaining that goes on here reflects the interests of the couple but is firmly rooted in a purpose. Receptions are a showcase for American culture and style, down to the wines from Oregon and salmon from Alaska that are served. They’re also about a diplomacy where fun and friendships can be used for productive outcomes. The duo has hosted movie premieres, LGBT events, trade meetings, and the annual Marine Corps Ball. Recently the ambassador presided over the entrepreneurial summit IN³, which was attended by King Felipe VI. Costos also organized the event’s gala dinner at Google’s new Madrid campus, where the king was seated with business leaders like Eric Schmidt of Google and Ana Botín of Banco Santander as well as young American and Spanish entrepreneurs, which is certainly not traditional royal protocol. The following evening, the postsummit party took place at the residence, with a buffet for 150 and a DJ who kept people dancing until 2 A.M.\n\n\n\n“No party or event is without a reason,” Costos says. “This is how we foster new relationships, open doors, and launch new ideas that create business opportunities, investments, and jobs in the U.S. and Spain.”\n\n\n\nIn his office at the main embassy building, a 1950s modernist tower adjacent to the residence, hang six etchings by James McNeill Whistler. Costos, who grew up with Greek immigrant grandparents in Lowell, Massachusetts, first saw those same works when, as a young boy, he visited the Whistler House Museum of Art in his hometown. They are a daily reminder of where he has come from and of the President’s advice upon his appointment: “Be yourself.”\n\n\n\nFollowing that directive, Costos and Smith have created something remarkable, a place they hope people will always be thrilled to visit. “My late friend Casey Ribicoff, widow of Senator Abe Ribicoff, said to me, ‘You never get jaded about going to the White House. It is always special,’” recounts Smith. “That is, in a mini way, what embassies all over the world should do—make you feel how special it is to be on American soil.”\n\n\n\n__[Click here to see more of the artful Madrid residence.](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/james-costos-michael-smith-designed-madrid-home-slideshow)__  \n  \n[#cneembed: embedjs/550a1c8061646d75b80c0000/video/55ea014161646d584d00000b.js]||||||",

      "body":"[View Slideshow](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/dan-fink-tim-murphy-designed-los-angeles-home-slideshow)\n\n\n\nAny new business en­­deavor needs a hook. After all, so often the key to success is identifying a niche, some corner of the market that has not yet been adequately served. Intentionally or not, this is precisely what [interior decorator Dan Fink](http://danfinkstudio.com/) has done with his design studio. Though based in New York City, Fink secures a majority of his projects on the West Coast, counting among his clients some of Silicon Valley’s most powerful figures—men and women he describes as having “suddenly found themselves with the means to buy that first dream home but who aren’t quite comfortable with the design establishment.”\n\n\n\nGrasping this dynamic was something Fink was uniquely qualified to do. His first job out of Stanford University was working as the assistant to a tech mogul. “These are people who run their businesses on efficiencies,” says the designer, who launched his firm in 2010. “I think I’ve been able to accommodate this need for speed and convenience and to explain things in a way they can relate to.” What’s more, the tech industry is used to allowing employees to operate without a lot of supervision or interference, which is any designer’s dream. “Their style is less about micromanaging and more about delegating,” Fink says.\n\n\n\nThat was certainly the case with one such entrepreneur seeking a Los Angeles home where he could enjoy the sunshine, entertain friends, and create a contemporary salon experience. “He has intellectual interests that are very wide-reaching,” Fink says of the client. “So he was seeking a venue to engage with people of all kinds on various subjects.” To that end Fink was asked to find the right property, oversee any construction or renovations, and furnish the interiors.\n\n\n\nGiven the area’s array of first-rate architecture and that the homeowner has what Fink characterizes as “a mind geared toward the future,” the designer’s plan had been to zero in on a classic modernist house, but nothing appropriate presented itself. What did, though, was an imperfect contemporary structure on an exciting site: a promontory that juts out like a diving board, with unobstructed views of downtown L.A. and Santa Monica in the distance. “It was the ideal spot to create something quite dramatic,” says the designer.\n\n\n\nTo make Fink’s vision a reality, the house was largely demolished, and San Francisco architect Tim Murphy was called into service. “We looked to a lot of Rudolph Schindler’s work for inspiration, as well as to old Hollywood,” Murphy says, including longtime MGM art director Cedric Gibbons’s 1930 villa in the Santa Monica Mountains. The result of Fink and Murphy’s partnership is both of-the-moment and timeless: a striking V-shaped building with towering steel casement windows set into white stucco walls. “We wanted it to have some grandeur,” Fink says.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55ef2625cd709ad62e905294]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nThat impression is reinforced indoors, where ceiling heights in several of the public spaces soar to almost 30 feet and energizing expanses of dramatically grained marble, sugary limestone, and rich walnut abound. “The volumes of the great room and the library are huge,” Murphy says. “They’re very beautiful, monumental spaces.” Equally bold is the great room’s spiral staircase, a sculptural gesture Fink dubbed “the double helix,” which rises to a steel catwalk that accesses the second floor.\n\n\n\nDespite the architecture’s majesty, the interiors actually exude intimacy, both in the grand main areas and in the private rooms, where the ceiling heights descend to a more human, though still lofty, 14 feet—among them the master suite and guest quarters. “The objective was to ensure that the homeowner would be as comfortable on his own as when he is entertaining,” Murphy remembers. Explains Fink, “Finding that balance between rough and fine, casual and dressy, keeps everything approachable.”\n\n\n\nFrom the laid-back contours of the tufted, leather-clad sofas in the library to the formality of the dining room’s klismos chairs, it’s a dazzling mix. And one made all\n\n\n\n the more so through strategically placed 20th-century treasures, including George Nakashima stools and Pierre Jeanneret chairs. “It was a pleasure to just look at, let alone buy, wonderful things for the house,” notes Fink, who also hung the vast rooms with gutsy photographs by Matthew Brandt, Anne Collier, and Thomas Ruff.\n\n\n\nSeductive as the sun-drenched interior spaces may be, the 40-foot-long infinity pool is perhaps the home’s most compelling feature. Placed on axis with the entrance hall, the pool shoots off from the rear of the house to the farthest edge of the cantilevered property. Surrounding it are generous outdoor entertaining areas punctuated by boxwood spheres and century-old olive trees, the work of landscape designer Scott Shrader. Here, the owner’s cerebral friends tend to congregate in fine weather, engrossed in lively discussions as well as poolside relaxation. As Fink says, “He immediately started using the house for all the things he’d envisioned.” And there’s no heartier endorsement than that.\n\n\n\n__[Click here to see more of the showstopping home.](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/dan-fink-tim-murphy-designed-los-angeles-home-slideshow)__",

      "body":"[View Slideshow](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/alexandra-angle-designed-johnson-weinberg-manhattan-home-slideshow)\n\n\n\nWorking his mobile phone from the stoop of his townhouse in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, Jason Weinberg raises no eyebrows and attracts no paparazzi. But the affable guy in the horn-rims is one of Hollywood’s most revered talent managers, a founding partner of Untitled Entertainment, and a master juggler of big-name clients such as Oscar winners Penélope Cruz, Melissa Leo, Jared Leto, and Eddie Redmayne. He’s also a family man, raising twin sons, Harry and Jasper, with screenwriter Merritt Johnson, who garnered a Writers Guild Award for his work on the HBO series In Treatment. \u2028\n\n\n\nThe children, in fact, are the reason that Weinberg and Johnson now call the East Coast home. They had been living in Los Angeles, traveling often to their New York pied-à-terre, but when the twins were accepted at a Manhattan private school, a new home base was required. Weinberg and Johnson found it in a 19th-century redbrick townhouse; out back was a remodeled carriage house that had been annexed to the main building in the 1950s. “It’s rare to have a townhouse connected to a loft,” the talent manager says—so rare that he and the real-estate agent cut a deal in 15 minutes flat, and the L.A. place was swiftly unloaded.\n\n\n\nThough the residence’s staid façade, neoclassical details, and intricate ironwork might seem inherently formal, its owners are anything but. So when it came time to tailor the interiors, they turned to the designer who knows them best: [Alexandra Angle](http://www.alexandraangle.com/), a college friend of Weinberg’s (he calls her “Alessa”) who shares the pair’s quick wit and love of modernism. With the help of landscape and construction firm [Halsted Welles Associates](http://halstedwelles.com/), the trio crafted a home with a winningly relaxed attitude and loads of fresh-faced style.\n\n\n\nThe first phase in the two-year renovation process was to open up the four-story dwelling. “It was pretty dark,” Weinberg remembers. “Now there are a lot of windows, huge skylights, and glass doors.” Walls may be largely painted white and wood floors bleached to a Scandinavian pallor, but color is everywhere. Spatial trickery, too. “The entrance hall was long and dark, so I thought it would be interesting to lengthen it further,” Angle says of her decision to paper the walls with horizontal stripes. The staircase seems exponentially taller as well, courtesy of a goth pattern of tree limbs.\n\n\n\nThe single soaring, light-filled space that makes up the ground floor is divvied up into areas for living, dining, and cooking. “We didn’t want three different rooms,” Weinberg explains. “So Alessa built bookcases that give just enough feeling of separation.” Johnson, meanwhile, was nostalgic for the snug spirit of their L.A. house. Thus the prevalence of upholstery that embraces, such as a sectional sofa (dressed in bark-brown velvet) that hugs one wall of the living area. Above it is a salon-style installation of black-and-white photos that bears witness to the close friendships that Weinberg has developed with his clients. Images of Mexico snapped by actress Jessica Lange hang alongside portraits of Blondie front woman Debbie Harry, the twins’ godmother and Harry’s namesake. “We’ve worked together for a long time,” Weinberg says of the singer.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55ef2614cd709ad62e90524a]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Johnson, unusual splashes of color add a playful note to the dining area. Bathed in the glow of a ceiling light shaped like a cloud is a vintage Raymond Loewy credenza made of injection-molded plastic. An eBay find, the piece arrived with two broken drawers, spurring Johnson to search for replacements. His stand-ins are delightfully mismatched: One red and one orange, they pop amid their muted-brown and gray companions.\n\n\n\nLuxe hotels provided the design inspiration for the couple’s private quarters, which occupy the third floor. “Every time we stay in a sleek, modern place like the Mercer, we think, Oh, this is the perfect way to live,” Weinberg says. A bemused Angle adds, “I understood what Jason and Merritt meant: Hotels are all about cleanliness, comfort, and order.” Down came walls and in came a wonderfully even-tempered master bedroom, bath, and sitting room that Weinberg calls “the hang-out suite.” A plaid-upholstered headboard is joined by smart club chairs and crisp cabinets, and mounted above the bed like a picture window is a large photograph of a dense forest by [Alexandra Hedison](http://www.hedison.com/), one of the residents’ favorite artists.\n\n\n\nHarry and Jasper’s playroom, meanwhile, is a schoolboy fun house, crowned by wacky kaleidoscopic wallpaper that visually elevates the low ceiling. World War II campaign desks are illuminated by a gargantuan vintage Anglepoise lamp, and nearby hangs a watercolor depicting a multiarmed alien—painted by the filmmaker Tim Burton. Even the stuffed animals have pedigrees. An imposing orangutan is part of a group of adoptees from actress Kirstie Alley’s collection of oversize toys.\n\n\n\nWeinberg and Johnson’s new home is precisely what the couple envisioned: a refuge for a modern family with boldface connections but a fuss-free lifestyle. Consider the twins’ latest birthday party, which Angle says was “cozy, crowded, and fabulous.” And, yes, star-studded. The designer notes that Lenny Kravitz and Zac Posen showed up, and a few A-list actresses brought their kids, as did plenty of noncelebrity friends. Cake was eaten, and the birthday boys and their pals raced indoors and outdoors, upstairs and downstairs.\n\n\n\n“We used the whole house,” Weinberg says, as pleased by the memory of the ruckus as he is by how the cross-country relocation has affected his family. “When I’m in L.A., it’s me alone and it’s all about business. Here, it’s all about us.”\n\n\n\n__[Click here to see more of this lively Manhattan townhouse.](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/alexandra-angle-designed-johnson-weinberg-manhattan-home-slideshow)__",
