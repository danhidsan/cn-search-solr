  "body":"\n\nOver the past two decades Sarah Herda and Joseph Grima, both curators in the architectural field, have led somewhat parallel lives, their careers progressing in tandem. But this fall their paths officially converge as co–artistic directors of the inaugural Chicago Architecture Biennial (CAB), the most comprehensive exhibition on contemporary architecture ever mounted in North America, running from October 3, 2015, to January 3, 2016.\n\n\n\nBorn a world apart—she in Seattle, he in Avignon, France—the two met during the 2006 Venice Architecture Biennale. At the time, Herda had just left her nine-year post as director of Manhattan’s Storefront for Art and Architecture, a role Grima would assume shortly thereafter. He now operates his own Genoa, Italy–based design practice, Space Caviar, while Herda heads up Chicago’s Graham Foundation, the U.S.’s largest architectural grant-giving organization. Through it all, the two have maintained a creative friendship. “We have extensive shared experiences,” says Herda, “but independently we’ve both built up vast networks.”\n\n[#image: /photos/55f1e237cd709ad62e905520]||||||\n\nThe pair will be putting their combined knowledge to inventive use at CAB. Taking over the Chicago Cultural Center, with additional programming around town, CAB will feature the work of some 100 international firms, each one developing its own project on a particular aspect of architecture, demonstrating a range of outside-the-box approaches. To coordinate them all is a logistical puzzle, but one Herda and Grima have taken to with aplomb. For them, CAB is an opportunity to not only present the global field as they see it—dizzyingly diverse, limitless in potential—but also do so on the biggest stage possible. “It’s a chance to build a new audience,” Herda says. “It’s not just architects speaking to architects, but architects speaking to the public on a very public platform.”\n\n\n\n*For more information go to [chicagoarchitecturebiennial.org](http://chicagoarchitecturebiennial.org/).*",
