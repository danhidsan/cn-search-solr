The Manhattan-based nonprofit Art Production Fund (APF) is the rare case that achieves both. Since starting the group 15 years ago, founders Yvonne \u2028Force Villareal and Doreen Remen—plus Casey Fremont, the organization’s director since 2004—have become powerful champions for public art, shepherding ambitious commissions \u2028by reigning stars. And today, more so than ever, the team has much to celebrate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f1e230cd709ad62e9054ee]||||||\n\nIn November, APF will unveil its largest project to date: a new work by artist Ugo Rondinone realized in collaboration with the Nevada Museum of Art. Titled Seven Magic Mountains, the long-term installation will comprise seven monumental totems—each made with brightly colored boulders—that rise from a stretch of desert outside Las Vegas. This past summer, meanwhile, the women debuted a playful series by Hanna Liden, who has populated lower Manhattan with bigger-than-life bagel sculptures that evoke the oeuvre of Claes Oldenburg. (“Hanna’s always thought of bagels as symbolizing this part of the world!” Villareal says.) Additionally, APF’s iconic 2005 Prada Marfa installation by Elmgreen & Dragset has earned its proper place in history after being granted museum status earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Great public art has a captivating immediacy that belies how \u2028difficult it can be to bring to fruition. Projects like those that APF produces typically involve a huge amount of logistical maneuvering, and, to be frank, a huge amount of cash. Rondinone’s sculptures, intended to be on view for two years, will require upwards of $3 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f1e230302ba71f301830fa]||||||\n\nThat the organization has so gracefully pivoted between traditional fundraising and grants while also brokering partnerships with galleries, museums, and corporate sponsors is no small feat. And though there are glamorous perks to their jobs, such as trekking off to various art fairs and biennials, as well as attending year-round openings and parties, all three women remain staunch advocates for art’s accessibility. As Remen notes, “Art is increasingly painted as elitist—you have to have money to experience \u2028art, you have to buy these expensive tickets, you have to stand in \u2028lines. We will always believe in bringing art directly to the public.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[__Click to see more of Art Production Fund's work.__](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/architecture/innovators/2015/art-production-fund-ad-innovators-2015-slideshow)",
