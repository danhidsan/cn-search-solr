  "body":"\n\nShould the office of the future be a place of creative cross-pollination, where various industries mingle spontaneously, then WeWork, the five-year-old co-office empire, is well ahead of its time. Armed with entrepreneurial know-how and a commitment to collaboration, the company’s founders, Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey, have crafted thoughtfully designed workplaces steeped in a millennial mind-set. “We are challenging the traditional concept of an office—the way work is done,” says Neumann, who was raised on a kibbutz in Israel. (McKelvey, similarly, grew up in a multifamily collective in Oregon.) “Real community cannot be built when there’s only one group.”\n\n\n\nWelcoming a mix that includes in­dividuals, small businesses, and satellite teams from larger enterprises, WeWork outposts foster their own creative economies with hip, humming communal spaces that make for prime professional mating grounds. Internal research reveals that 60 percent of tenants have forged business relationships with one another. And it’s not simply the free beer on tap that gives each location its positive energy. “Apart from differentiating our spaces with design, we also look for buildings that have distinctive character,” says McKelvey, a former architect. “We make sure every seat is a good one.”\n\n\n\nIn today’s booming market for shared office spaces, no such venture has displayed more forward thinking than WeWork. Or, for that matter, more growth. After launching in 2010 with a 28,000-square-foot lease in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood, the outfit now has 46 locations around the world. It was recently valued at $10 billion, putting it in the same league as Pinterest, Spotify, and Dropbox.\n\n\n\nIn 2017 WeWork will complete its first structure from the ground up: a 675,000-square-foot edifice at the edge of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. More exciting still is the company’s recent acquisition of Case, a consulting firm (and onetime WeWork tenant) that has developed information-modeling technology to streamline building construction. The merger promises to facilitate expansion. “Now we have the smartest people making technology just for us,” Neumann says. “For a long time, Case’s thinking was years ahead of us. We’ve caught up.”\n\n\n\n*For more information go to [wework.com](https://www.wework.com/)*",
