  "body":"[View Slideshow](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/alexandra-angle-designed-johnson-weinberg-manhattan-home-slideshow)\n\n\n\nWorking his mobile phone from the stoop of his townhouse in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, Jason Weinberg raises no eyebrows and attracts no paparazzi. But the affable guy in the horn-rims is one of Hollywood’s most revered talent managers, a founding partner of Untitled Entertainment, and a master juggler of big-name clients such as Oscar winners Penélope Cruz, Melissa Leo, Jared Leto, and Eddie Redmayne. He’s also a family man, raising twin sons, Harry and Jasper, with screenwriter Merritt Johnson, who garnered a Writers Guild Award for his work on the HBO series In Treatment. \u2028\n\n\n\nThe children, in fact, are the reason that Weinberg and Johnson now call the East Coast home. They had been living in Los Angeles, traveling often to their New York pied-à-terre, but when the twins were accepted at a Manhattan private school, a new home base was required. Weinberg and Johnson found it in a 19th-century redbrick townhouse; out back was a remodeled carriage house that had been annexed to the main building in the 1950s. “It’s rare to have a townhouse connected to a loft,” the talent manager says—so rare that he and the real-estate agent cut a deal in 15 minutes flat, and the L.A. place was swiftly unloaded.\n\n\n\nThough the residence’s staid façade, neoclassical details, and intricate ironwork might seem inherently formal, its owners are anything but. So when it came time to tailor the interiors, they turned to the designer who knows them best: [Alexandra Angle](http://www.alexandraangle.com/), a college friend of Weinberg’s (he calls her “Alessa”) who shares the pair’s quick wit and love of modernism. With the help of landscape and construction firm [Halsted Welles Associates](http://halstedwelles.com/), the trio crafted a home with a winningly relaxed attitude and loads of fresh-faced style.\n\n\n\nThe first phase in the two-year renovation process was to open up the four-story dwelling. “It was pretty dark,” Weinberg remembers. “Now there are a lot of windows, huge skylights, and glass doors.” Walls may be largely painted white and wood floors bleached to a Scandinavian pallor, but color is everywhere. Spatial trickery, too. “The entrance hall was long and dark, so I thought it would be interesting to lengthen it further,” Angle says of her decision to paper the walls with horizontal stripes. The staircase seems exponentially taller as well, courtesy of a goth pattern of tree limbs.\n\n\n\nThe single soaring, light-filled space that makes up the ground floor is divvied up into areas for living, dining, and cooking. “We didn’t want three different rooms,” Weinberg explains. “So Alessa built bookcases that give just enough feeling of separation.” Johnson, meanwhile, was nostalgic for the snug spirit of their L.A. house. Thus the prevalence of upholstery that embraces, such as a sectional sofa (dressed in bark-brown velvet) that hugs one wall of the living area. Above it is a salon-style installation of black-and-white photos that bears witness to the close friendships that Weinberg has developed with his clients. Images of Mexico snapped by actress Jessica Lange hang alongside portraits of Blondie front woman Debbie Harry, the twins’ godmother and Harry’s namesake. “We’ve worked together for a long time,” Weinberg says of the singer.\n\n\n\nThanks to Johnson, unusual splashes of color add a playful note to the dining area. Bathed in the glow of a ceiling light shaped like a cloud is a vintage Raymond Loewy credenza made of injection-molded plastic. An eBay find, the piece arrived with two broken drawers, spurring Johnson to search for replacements. His stand-ins are delightfully mismatched: One red and one orange, they pop amid their muted-brown and gray companions.\n\n\n\nLuxe hotels provided the design inspiration for the couple’s private quarters, which occupy the third floor. “Every time we stay in a sleek, modern place like the Mercer, we think, Oh, this is the perfect way to live,” Weinberg says. A bemused Angle adds, “I understood what Jason and Merritt meant: Hotels are all about cleanliness, comfort, and order.” Down came walls and in came a wonderfully even-tempered master bedroom, bath, and sitting room that Weinberg calls “the hang-out suite.” A plaid-upholstered headboard is joined by smart club chairs and crisp cabinets, and mounted above the bed like a picture window is a large photograph of a dense forest by [Alexandra Hedison](http://www.hedison.com/), one of the residents’ favorite artists.\n\n\n\nHarry and Jasper’s playroom, meanwhile, is a schoolboy fun house, crowned by wacky kaleidoscopic wallpaper that visually elevates the low ceiling. World War II campaign desks are illuminated by a gargantuan vintage Anglepoise lamp, and nearby hangs a watercolor depicting a multiarmed alien—painted by the filmmaker Tim Burton. Even the stuffed animals have pedigrees. An imposing orangutan is part of a group of adoptees from actress Kirstie Alley’s collection of oversize toys.\n\n\n\nWeinberg and Johnson’s new home is precisely what the couple envisioned: a refuge for a modern family with boldface connections but a fuss-free lifestyle. Consider the twins’ latest birthday party, which Angle says was “cozy, crowded, and fabulous.” And, yes, star-studded. The designer notes that Lenny Kravitz and Zac Posen showed up, and a few A-list actresses brought their kids, as did plenty of noncelebrity friends. Cake was eaten, and the birthday boys and their pals raced indoors and outdoors, upstairs and downstairs.\n\n\n\n“We used the whole house,” Weinberg says, as pleased by the memory of the ruckus as he is by how the cross-country relocation has affected his family. “When I’m in L.A., it’s me alone and it’s all about business. Here, it’s all about us.”\n\n\n\n__[Click here to see more of this lively Manhattan townhouse.](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/alexandra-angle-designed-johnson-weinberg-manhattan-home-slideshow)__",
