  "body":"[View Slideshow](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/patrick-dempsey-frank-gehry-malibu-california-home-slideshow)\n\n\n\nTime has a way of domesticating what once seemed radical and avant-garde. In 1968, when Frank Gehry started work on a combined studio and residence in Malibu, California, for artist Ron Davis, the architect was still an outlier, just beginning his revolutionary experiments with forms and materials. Nearly half a century later, Gehry has won virtually every honor his profession has to offer. And the rhomboidal corrugated-metal-clad live/work space he created for Davis? Today it is the warm, artfully decorated home that actor Patrick Dempsey and his wife, Jillian, a makeup artist and jewelry designer, share with their three children, 12-year-old daughter Talula and seven-year-old twin sons Darby and Sullivan.\n\n\n\n\"We were looking for a little land and space, and a house with some architectural significance,\" the *Grey’s Anatomy* star recalls of their search for a new home five years ago. \"The exterior’s simplicity appealed to me, and the inside felt very expansive and calming. Everywhere you looked there was something visually pleasing.\"\n\n\n\nOf course, the structure’s metamorphosis from bohemian atelier to family domicile didn’t happen overnight. When the Dempseys discovered the Gehry house, the original façade and footprint were largely intact but the interiors had been renovated and the nearly five-acre grounds transformed by the previous owners, spa entrepreneurs Sue and Alex Glasscock, who had collaborated with decorator Michael Lee and landscape designer [Scott Shrader](http://www.shraderdesign.com/).\n\n\n\n\"We really admired what the Glasscocks had done and wanted to respect their vision,\" Patrick says of the former residents, who still live in the area, where they own the Ranch at Live Oak Malibu, an award-winning fitness resort. \"So we decided to give Scott a chance to expand on his master plan for the landscape.\"\n\n\n\nA decade ago, when Shrader began reimagining the grounds for the Glasscocks, the landscape was a \"jewel in the rough, a real mess,\" the designer remembers. The approximately 5,000-square-foot dwelling—which the Glasscocks had dubbed Tin House, a name they emblazoned in block letters alongside the front door—sat on an undeveloped dirt parcel, with an asphalt drive and no proper outdoor living spaces. Shrader regraded the site, installed a pea-gravel approach shaded by olive trees, and added front and rear courtyards paved with reclaimed cobblestones. Most significant, to provide structure and intimacy, he introduced lush terraced gardens with built-in seating and low walls made of raw chunks of recycled concrete.\n\n\n\n\"When Patrick and Jillian moved in with the children, it changed the dynamic of the property,\" Shrader says. In response, he made the outdoors a family fun zone, with a broad, flat lawn for soccer games, an alfresco kitchen with a pizza oven, a breezy dining area topped by a canopy of woven wicker, and coops, hutches, and other enclosures for the Dempseys’ ever-growing menagerie of chickens, miniature donkeys, rabbits, goats, pigs, and one rescued African tortoise. (Rounding out this relatively peaceable kingdom are three dogs.) And because of Jillian’s interest in organic gardening, Shrader says, \"we converted the Glasscocks’ riding arena into an extensive tract of planting beds for an array of vegetables and flowers.\"\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55e78cd2cd709ad62e8ff347]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nThe luxurious outdoor entertaining and play areas add a gracious dimension to a house that, despite its interior emendations and refinements, remains a somewhat unconventional setup for a family of five. \"The house is very warm and communal, and all the vibrant spaces that Gehry devised really inspire creativity,\" says Jillian, who maintains a sculpture studio and jewelry workshop on the mezzanine level. \"But it has its challenges,\" she continues with a laugh. \"The kitchen is pretty small, and you can hear every sound that’s made all over the house. Occasionally Patrick and I use the Airstream parked in the garden for date night.\"\n\n\n\nTo give coziness and livability to the idiosyncratic interior spaces, several of which are defined by partial walls, the Dempseys called on [Estee Stanley](http://www.esteestanley.com/), a decorator and fashion stylist who had designed their previous residence. Playing off the honeyed tones and earthy texture of the flooring (which resembles lovingly refinished barn wood but is actually repurposed scaffolding), Stanley brought in numerous antiques and vintage objects rich with patina, as well as custom-made furnishings, and organized everything into smart, comfortable vignettes ideal for repose.\n\n\n\n\"Estee’s work has a feminine vibe that brings a second energy to the tougher, more muscular forms of the architecture,\" Patrick observes. \"She’s also very attuned to the kind of soulful antiques and art we love to collect.\" That assemblage includes artworks by Robert Irwin, John McCracken, and DeWain Valentine—mandarins of the Light and Space movement that emerged in Southern California around the time Gehry was designing the house—along with pieces by Ed Ruscha, 1960s bubble photographs by Melvin Sokolsky, and, in the living room, an imposing graffiti painting by the contemporary artist Retna.\n\n\n\nSituated just inside the front door, an Irwin light sculpture makes a particularly, and appropriately, engaging gesture of welcome to the Dempseys’ world of natural and man-made wonders. \"The Irwin pops and sizzles when you turn it on, and the light levels continually change, so you feel like you’re having a dialogue with it,\" the actor says. \"It’s a lot like the house itself, which pops and cracks throughout the day as the temperature changes, as if it were speaking to you. The whole place really is a work of art.\"\n\n\n\n__Take a tour of [Patrick Dempsey's inviting family home in Malibu, California](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/patrick-dempsey-frank-gehry-malibu-california-home-slideshow).__",
