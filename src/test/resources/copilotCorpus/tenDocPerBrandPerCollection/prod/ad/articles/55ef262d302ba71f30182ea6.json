A work by John Singer Sargent—after Diego Velázquez—it is one of more than 80 pieces borrowed through the Art in Embassies program by the current U.S. Ambassador to Spain and Andorra, James Costos, and his longtime partner, designer Michael S. Smith. The Sargent marks the passage from the main floor’s public spaces to the private areas upstairs, and quite often guests will find, lying on the carpet beneath the painting, one of the couple’s two rescue dogs, Greco, who bears a notable resemblance to the dog in the 19th-century portrait. The painting can be seen as a symbol of the long history of cultural dialogue between the U.S. and Spain, not to mention a reminder of the consideration that Smith and Costos put into every detail of their comprehensive renovation of the residence. That Greco (named in honor of both the Spanish Old Master El Greco and the ambassador’s Greek ancestry) is allowed to meet visitors is also emblematic of the warm, open, modern style of diplomacy being practiced here.\n\n\n\n“Half the fun of working on the residence is that we get to live in it, and half is that this is part of our legacy to James’s ambassadorship,” says Smith, who dedicated a huge amount of time and significant personal funds to the renovation. The Los Angeles–based designer, who is known for mixing a love of old-world antiques with a casually refined sensibility, emphasizes that this project was truly exceptional. One reason, he notes, is that it has “an expiration date” for him and Costos, whose service will end when President Obama finishes his second term. So the couple, who will be leaving behind numerous furnishings as gifts, aimed to create a flexible setting that would suit future ambassadors.\n\n\n\n“I might have found this frustrating if I hadn’t done the White House,” explains Smith, who designed the Obamas’ private quarters as well as the Oval Office, and, more recently, updated the White House dining room. “It is a moment in history, and it is a moment that stays.” His intention was for the upstairs guest chambers at the ambassador’s residence to have a distinctly European aesthetic, reminding visitors they are in Madrid. He envisioned the downstairs, meanwhile, as the epitome of classic American decorating, in the vein of Billy Baldwin and Mark Hampton, because that is where most of the Spanish guests are entertained. Take Smith’s favorite space, the living room, which features a blend of antique, vintage modern, and contemporary furniture, with accents ranging from a 12-panel Coromandel screen (once owned by Coco Chanel) to a Philip Guston painting borrowed from American art patron Agnes Gund. Says Smith, “The room is clean and elegant but has weight and scale to it.”\n\n\n\nThroughout the renovation, Smith worked with a State Department design team headed by Jenny Howery-Ford to integrate his own pieces with existing furniture, such as the dining room’s table, which seats up to 30, and vast 19th-century Persian carpet. He also included items sourced in Spain, among them rugs woven in Alicante and pottery from Toledo.\n\n\n\n“I am so proud of Michael’s work at the residence,” says Costos, who was a senior executive at HBO before becoming ambassador. “He’s created a modern platform that embodies the patriotic feeling of an American embassy but is still very much a welcoming home.”\n\n\n\nPerhaps what most gives the residence its distinctive feel is the art. The works installed here represent one of the most extensive Art in Embassies projects ever undertaken. Some pieces came directly from artists, such as Ed Ruscha’s Screaming in Spanish—which hangs in the entrance hall with Robert Rauschenberg’s Bilbao Scraps—and the Glenn Ligon neon work Double America, which glows in the dining room. “We wanted art that highlights America and the connection between Spain and the U.S., and we also targeted pieces by artists who we knew would come and discuss their work,” Smith says. Now Spanish schoolchildren regularly tour the house with a curator or visiting artist.\n\n\n\nCostos has opened up the residence for numerous events, and an invite from the ambassador has become a hot ticket in Madrid. Like the art, however, the entertaining that goes on here reflects the interests of the couple but is firmly rooted in a purpose. Receptions are a showcase for American culture and style, down to the wines from Oregon and salmon from Alaska that are served. They’re also about a diplomacy where fun and friendships can be used for productive outcomes. The duo has hosted movie premieres, LGBT events, trade meetings, and the annual Marine Corps Ball. Recently the ambassador presided over the entrepreneurial summit IN³, which was attended by King Felipe VI. Costos also organized the event’s gala dinner at Google’s new Madrid campus, where the king was seated with business leaders like Eric Schmidt of Google and Ana Botín of Banco Santander as well as young American and Spanish entrepreneurs, which is certainly not traditional royal protocol. The following evening, the postsummit party took place at the residence, with a buffet for 150 and a DJ who kept people dancing until 2 A.M.\n\n\n\n“No party or event is without a reason,” Costos says. “This is how we foster new relationships, open doors, and launch new ideas that create business opportunities, investments, and jobs in the U.S. and Spain.”\n\n\n\nIn his office at the main embassy building, a 1950s modernist tower adjacent to the residence, hang six etchings by James McNeill Whistler. Costos, who grew up with Greek immigrant grandparents in Lowell, Massachusetts, first saw those same works when, as a young boy, he visited the Whistler House Museum of Art in his hometown. They are a daily reminder of where he has come from and of the President’s advice upon his appointment: “Be yourself.”\n\n\n\nFollowing that directive, Costos and Smith have created something remarkable, a place they hope people will always be thrilled to visit. “My late friend Casey Ribicoff, widow of Senator Abe Ribicoff, said to me, ‘You never get jaded about going to the White House. It is always special,’” recounts Smith. “That is, in a mini way, what embassies all over the world should do—make you feel how special it is to be on American soil.”\n\n\n\n__[Click here to see more of the artful Madrid residence.](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2015-10/james-costos-michael-smith-designed-madrid-home-slideshow)__",
