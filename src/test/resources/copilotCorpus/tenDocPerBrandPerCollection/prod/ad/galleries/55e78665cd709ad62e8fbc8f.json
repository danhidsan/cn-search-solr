And then it was turned around and had a new front put on it by the Victorians. So it’s really been through the mill. But Thomas Hardy used to come and write in our morning room. He wrote a particularly long short story, almost a novelette, called *The Waiting Supper,* which is set in our house. And, in fact, our local church in our village is where Angel Clare marries Tess of the d’Urbervilles.”\n\n\n\nFellowes is pictured here with his wife, Emma Fellowes.",

We’re only about a mile from Stonehenge. And we would find old English coins, Anglo-Saxon bits and pieces all the time.”\n\n\n\nBarker is pictured here with his wife, Cristen Barker.",
