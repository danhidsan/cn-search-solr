  "body":"The college postseason is upon us, and with it we'll get a chance to see schools from across the country try to earn their way into the NCAA regionals by winning their conference championships. In golf, as is the case in most sports, schools that win their conference receive automatic bids to regionals, essentially giving all programs a crack at NCAA glory.\n\n\n\nWith all that's on the line we'll take a insider look at all the conference championships over the next two-plus weeks, highlighting the team and individual favorites in each. As the schedule plays out, we'll keep you up to speed with updates every few days.\n\n\n\nWithout further ado, here's a look at the first wave of conference tournaments.\n\n\n\n__MEN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Colonial Athletic Association](http://www.caasports.com/sports/mgolf/)__\n\n[#image: /photos/55ad700fb01eefe207f66a2e]|||Caa_1|||\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite: Pinehurst (N.C.)

[The Panthers have been ranked in the top 10 nationally since late fall](http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwath/golf-m/index.htm) and with by far the deepest team among the 11 squads competing, should cruise to the team title.
