  "body":"FEATURED TOURNAMENTS for the week of March 20\n\n\n\n__Men\n\n\n\nHootie at Bulls Bay Collegiate Invitational__(Click for Live Scoring from [Golfstat](http://www.golfstatresults.com/public/index.cfm?tournament_id=685))__\n\n\n\n[Bulls Bay GC](http://www.bullsbaygolf.com/) __(Par 71, 7,200 yards)__\n\n\n\nAwendaw, S.C.\n\n\n\nMarch 26-28__\n\n\n\nThe second-year event, put on by Bulls Bay owner __Joe Rice__, offers players a few sweet perks, not the least being the chance to play this standout new course designed by the late [__Mike Strantz__](http://www.golfdigest.com/courses/index.ssf?/courses/gd200509strantz.html) that opened outside Charleston in winter 2001. As was the case a year ago, teams, along with tournament sponsors and guests, also will be treated to a concert by [Hootie and the Blowfish](http://www.hootie.com/) (band members [__Darius Rucker__](http://www.dariusrucker.com/), [__Mark Bryan__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bryan), [__Dean Felber__](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0270887/) and [__Jim Sonefeld__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Sonefeld) at all members at the course as well as University of South Carolina alumni). The tournament raised $30,000 last year for the Hootie and the B__lowfish Foundation to improve public education in the Palmetto State, and tournament chairman Doug Carnes__ hopes to reach that figure again this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina, Clemson and the College of Charleston share hosting duties for the event, which was [won by Kentucky in a one-hole playoff over Augusta State a year ago](http://www.ukathletics.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=40&url_article_id=15311&change_well_id=2). Current PGA Tour rookie [__J.B. Holmes__](http://www.pgatour.com/players/intro/594119), a Wildcat senior in 2005, made a birdie on the playoff hole to give his team the victory. [Augusta State’s __Scott Jamieson took the individual title with a eight-under 205 score__](http://www.aug.edu/athletics/pages/Golf%20News/2001-02%20latest%20news/0405golf24.htm), five better than Wake Forest’s [__Webb Simpson__](http://wakeforestsports.collegesports.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/simpson_webb00.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year’s favorites include the local schools as well as North Carolina, which is coming off its first team win since the fall of 2004 after claiming the title at last week's Schenkel E-Z-Go Invitational.\n\n\n\n__FIELD:__ No. 20 [Alabama](http://www.rolltide.com/Mens%20Golf/4416.asp), [Auburn](http://auburntigers.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/aub-w-golf-body.html), [Augusta State](http://www.aug.edu/athletics/sports/mgolf.htm), [Central Florida](http://ucfathletics.collegesports.com/sports/m-golf/ucf-m-golf-body.html), [College of Charleston](http://www.cofcsports.com/home/?/sports/mglf), No. 15 [Clemson](http://clemsontigers.collegesports.com/sports/m-golf/clem-m-golf-body.html), [Florida State](http://seminoles.collegesports.com/sports/m-golf/fsu-m-golf-body.html), No. 22 [Kentucky](http://www.ukathletics.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=40&change_well_id=1), [LSU](http://www.lsusports.net/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&KEY=&SPID=2175&SPSID=27875), [North Carolina](http://tarheelblue.collegesports.com/sports/m-golf/unc-m-golf-body.html), [N.C.

Suffice it to say, Murphey’s accomplishments at Georgia were considerable. Under her leadership as assistant athletic director for women’s sports, Bulldogs’ teams won eight of 14 SEC women’s all-sports awards, presented annually to the outstanding program in the conference. She also oversaw the women’s golf team when it became an official varsity sport in 1978, leading the squad to 21 team and 18 individual titles from 1978 to 1986, and eventually became a charter member of the [National Golf Coaches Association’s Hall of Fame](http://ngca.collegiategolf.com/home.jsp?page=9).\n\n\n\nAs the Bulldogs look to host the event, they also are trying to make it back-to-back-to-back victories in the tournament (and 12 team triumphs overall). [A year ago Georgia went wire-to-wire to win by 13 shots over LSU](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/recaps/032705aaa.html). More importantly, [__Todd McCorkle__](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/mtt/mccorkle_todd00.html)’s squad is looking to return to the form it showed in the fall, when Georgia finished no worse than third in any event compared to this spring, where it has posted [an 11th-place finish at the Arizona Wildcat](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/recaps/022106aac.html) in February and a [T-4 at the Cal Guadalajara Invitational](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/recaps/030806aaa.html).\n\n\n\nLeading the charge for the Bulldogs will be [__Kelly Froelich__](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/mtt/froelich_kelly00.html), the event’s defending champion individually. [The senior’s two-over 218 total won the event by two shots](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/recaps/032705aaa.html) and allowed her to join a distinguished list of past winners, including [__Hollis Stacy__](http://www.lpga.com/player_results.aspx?id=555) (1973, Rollins); [__Beth Daniel__](http://www.lpga.com/player_results.aspx?id=198) (1977, Furman); [__Juli Inkster__](http://www.lpga.com/player_results.aspx?id=168) (1982, San Jose State), __Jody Rosenthal__ (1983, 1984, 1985, Tulsa) and [__Vicki Goetze-Ackermann__](http://www.lpga.com/player_results.aspx?id=452) (1992, Georgia).\n\n\n\nAnother Georgia players to watch are [__Whitney Wade__](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/mtt/wade_whitney00.html), a junior who leads the team with a 72.78 stroke average, and [__Taylor Leon__](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/mtt/leon_taylor00.html), a freshman who just trails Wade with a 72.83 average. Leon and her two brothers ([__Tyler__](http://www.okstate.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=1708&SPID=156&DB_OEM_ID=200&ATCLID=28536&Q_SEASON=2005) and [__Trent__](http://www.okstate.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=1708&SPID=156&DB_OEM_ID=200&ATCLID=224528&Q_SEASON=2005)) were [the subject of a profile I wrote for *Golf World in our March 17 issue*](http://www.golfdigest.com/newsandtour/index.ssf?/newsandtour/gw20060317leons.html).\n\n\n\nLook for Auburn, coming off a two-tournament win streak, and Arkansas, with former Bulldog [__Kelley Hester__](http://www.ladybacks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=11707&SPID=688&DB_OEM_ID=2300&ATCLID=67842&Q_SEASON=2005) at the helm, to provide the toughest challenges.\n\n\n\n__FIELD:__ No. 9 [Arkansas](http://www.ladybacks.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=2300&KEY=&SPID=688&SPSID=11701), No. 4 [Auburn](http://auburntigers.collegesports.com/sports/m-golf/aub-m-golf-body.html), [Coastal Carolina](http://www.goccusports.com/womensgolf/), [East Carolina](http://ecupirates.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/ecu-w-golf-body.html), [Florida State](http://seminoles.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/fsu-w-golf-body.html), [Furman](http://furmanpaladins.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/furm-w-golf-body.html), No. 8 [Georgia](http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/geo-w-golf-body.html), [Kent State](http://www.kentstatesports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=24&change_well_id=1), [Michigan State](http://msuspartans.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/msu-w-golf-body.html), [Mississippi](http://olemisssports.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/ole-w-golf-body.html), [Mississippi State](http://www.mstateathletics.com/index.php?s=&change_well_id=1&url_channel_id=20), No. 20 [Ohio State](http://ohiostatebuckeyes.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/), [Oklahoma](http://www.soonersports.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=300&KEY=&SPID=204&SPSID=2778), [South Carolina](http://uscsports.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/scar-w-golf-body.html), No. 13 [Vanderbilt](http://vucommodores.com/sports/wgolf/), No. 12 [Wake Forest](http://wakeforestsports.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/wake-w-golf-body.html), No. 24 [Washington](http://gohuskies.collegesports.com/sports/w-golf/wash-w-golf-body.html).",
