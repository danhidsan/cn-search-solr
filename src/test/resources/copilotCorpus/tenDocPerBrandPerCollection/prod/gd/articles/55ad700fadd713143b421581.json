  "body":"Four more berths to the NCAA regional field are up for grabs in the next few days. Here is how we see things shaking out:\n\n\n\n__[Mountain West](http://themwc.cstv.com/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__\n\nSite: Sunriver (Ore.) Resort Crosswater Course (For live scoring, check out [Golfstat](http://www.golfstatresults.com/public/index.cfm?tournament_id=711).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Dates:__ April 27-29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Defending champion:__ New Mexico; Nick Becker, BYU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField: U.S. Air Force Academy, No. 6 BYU, Colorado State, New Mexico, San Diego State, TCU, Utah, No. 7 UNLV, Wyoming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Skinny:__ There’s definitely a fair number of storylines to follow as the MWC is played at Crosswater for the sixth straight year. This time around, it serves as a preview of nationals as the NCAA Championship will be held there in June. [New addition to the conference TCU is coming off winning the Conference USA title four straight times](http://gofrogs.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/042606aaa.html), while [three-time defending MWC champion New Mexico looks to extend the mark to four](http://golobos.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/042506aaa.html). Both teams are solid but not spectacular, giving the rest of the field a definite chance to claim the title. The likely teams in the hunt will be UNLV, BYU and San Diego State. [The Rebels have held their own in the post-__Ryan Moore era, with two wins__](http://unlvrebels.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/042606aab.html), but their line-up lacks post-season experience and that could be an issue. [San Diego State is an upstart](http://goaztecs.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/042706aab.html) with more talent than you might realize (four players having posted top-five finishes this year), but the question of how they’ll hold up in the post-season also is a big one. Thus, we’re going to go with [BYU, a squad that has the ability to go low](http://www.golfdigest.com/search/index.ssf?/newsandtour/campus/20060210insider.html), that doesn’t mind flying in under the radar and that has players that might not might be colorful but are confident. Meanwhile, like the team race, the individual title is pretty wide open. New Mexico senior [__Jay Choi__](http://golobos.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/choi_jay00.html) has a spring victory and the talent to win under pressure. BYU senior [__Oscar Alvarez__](http://www.byucougars.com/Profile.jsp?ID=1092) won the Morris Williams a few weeks ago yet has had two middle of the road showings since. San Diego State’s [__Aaron Goldberg__](http://goaztecs.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/goldberg_aaron00.html) and [__Andrew Scott__](http://goaztecs.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/scott_andrew00.html) have outside shots, as does TCU’s [__Jon McLean__](http://gofrogs.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/mclean_jon00.html), but we’re thinking the final result will be Alvarez holding off a hard charging [__Andres Gonzalez__](http://unlvrebels.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/gonzales_andres01.html) of UNLV, winning by two shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n__[Big Ten](http://www.bigten.org)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__\n\n[#image: /photos/55ad700fb01eefe207f66a26]|||Big_ten_men|||Site: Conway Farms CC, Lake Forest, Ill. (For live scoring, check out [Golfstat](http://www.golfstatresults.com/public/index.cfm?tournament_id=703).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Dates:__ April 28-30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Defending champion:__ Michigan State; Jeff Overton, Indiana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Field:__ Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue, Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Skinny:__ It’s a bit of a down year for the Big Ten, with no teams ranked in the top 25 (Northwestern and Minnesota having fallen off the list during the season). Both the Wildcats and Golden Gophers will be in the mix, as will some teams that haven’t made much noise this season contend—specifically Michigan State, with senior [__Matt Harmon__](http://msuspartans.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/harmon_matt00.html) more than capable of carrying the defending champion Spartans. Ohio State could be a factor too. [But the conference’s hottest team is Indiana](http://iuhoosiers.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/042706aab.html), winner of two of its last three events, and while having three freshmen in the lineup ([__Jorge Campillo__](http://iuhoosiers.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/campillo_jorge00.html), [__Drew Allenspach__](http://iuhoosiers.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/allenspach_drew00.html) and [__Seth Brandon__](http://iuhoosiers.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/brandon_seth00.html)), the Hoosiers are able to feed off youthful exuberance to overcome lack of experience. Look for IU to win its nine Big Ten title, but just its third since 1976. No doubt, too, Campillo, Allenspach and Brandon will all also be in the hunt for medalist, as will Northwestern junior [__David Merkow__](http://nusports.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/merkow_david00.html) and likely fifth-year senior [__Dillon Dougherty__](http://nusports.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/dougherty_dillon00.html). But we’ll take Harmon, a gritty player who impressed with his victory at the Schenkel E-Z-Go Invitational in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n__[Metro Atlantic Athletic](http://www.maacsports.com/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__\n\n[#image: /photos/55ad700eb01eefe207f66a23]|||Maac|||Site: Disney World Resort, Palm Course, Lake Buena Vista, Fla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Dates:__ April 28-30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Defending champion:__ Loyola (Md.); Bryan Bigley, Siena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Field:__ Canisius, Fairfield, Iona, Loyola (Md.), Manhattan, Niagara, Rider, St. Peter’s, Siena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Skinny:__ Loyola comes in as the three-time defending champion, but will find a fourth straight title tough to win thanks to a game Siena squad. The last time the Saints won the MAAC title was 1991 and we’re figuring that they’re finally due. Individually, Siena junior [__Bryan Bigley__](http://sienasaints.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/bigley_bryan00.html) has a 74.59 stroke average, second to Loyola’s [__Michael Mulieri__](http://loyolagreyhounds.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/mulieri_michael00.html) (73.76), but we think he’ll be able to pull off the mild upset and claim the top honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n](http://www.wac.org/view_sport.asp?id=7)__[Western Athletic](http://www.wac.org/view_sport.asp?id=7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__[#image: /photos/55ad700eadd713143b42157a]|||Wac_men|||Site: Crane Creek CC, Boise, Idaho (Par 71, 6668 yards)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Dates:__ May 1-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Defending champion:__ SMU; David Inglis, Tulsa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Field:__Boise State, Fresno State, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana Tech, Nevada, New Mexico State, San Jose State, Utah State\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__Skinny:__ [As has been the case with many of the conferences, turnover in the ranks has some new faces for 2006, or more memorably some teams that aren’t still there](http://www.wac.org/view_sport.asp?id=7). A year ago, SMU was declared the tourney winner when the team the school tied with in regulation, Tulsa, was forced to leave because they otherwise would have missed their flight home and exams for many the next day. Of those set to play in 2006, three seem to stand out as legitimate contenders: New Mexico State, Nevada and Fresno State. We’ll take the conference newcomers in the Aggies, but only by a slim margin. Meanwhile, individually the conference will get a new winner for the first time in four years after __David Inglis__ equaled __Justin Leonard__’s mark of winning the title all four seasons in school. The candidates to replace Inglis on top of the leader board are varied with no clear cut selection. New Mexico State’s [__Danny Bowen__](http://www.nmstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=9848&amp;SPID=596&amp;DB_OEM_ID=1900&amp;ATCLID=62658&amp;Q_SEASON=2005) has the most recent tournament win, while Fresno State’s [__Jason Anthony__](http://gobulldogs.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/anthony_jason00.html) and [__Brian Kelley__](http://gobulldogs.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/kelley_brian00.html) are both playing solid of late. Still, the individual with the best chance for victory is Boise State senior [__Graham DeLaet__](http://www.broncosports.com/golf/mroster.asp?athleteid=1290), who already has nine college titles to his credit but has yet to win a conference championship.",
