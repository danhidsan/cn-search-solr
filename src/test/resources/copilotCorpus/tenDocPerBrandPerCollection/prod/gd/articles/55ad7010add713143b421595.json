Needless to say, [the Waves will have to get out of their funk if their to win their eighth straight conference championship](http://pepperdinesports.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/041306aab.html), particularly with [San Diego](http://usdtoreros.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/usd-m-golf-body.html) actually entering the tournament with a better team scoring average. Our crystal ball says that Pepperdine’s reign ends here as the Toreros make the NCAA regionals for the first time in school history.

The Bucs have won 20 conference titles in their history and while Belmont, Mercer, North Florida and Jacksonville should provide a mild challenge, ETSU is likely to become just the third team in A-Sun history to win the conference title in their first appearance. Don’t be at all surprised when ETSU junior [__Rhys Davies__](http://www.etsubucs.com/sports/mgolf/rosters/displayPlayer.asp?PLAYER_ID=1319) keeps Jacksonville’s [__Duncan Stewart__](http://judolphins.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/stewart_duncan00.html) from becoming the third player to win medalist honors in back to back years while also holding off Jacksonville’s [__Russell Knox__](http://judolphins.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/mtt/knox_russell00.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n__[Sun Belt](http://www.sunbeltsports.org/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4100&amp;SPID=1814)__\n\n[#image: /photos/55ad7010add713143b42158d]|||Sun_belt_1|||\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite: PGA GC, Port St. Lucie, Fla.

Injury woes, however, will prevent South Alabama from willing the title again, opening the door for others. Five of the 10 teams in the field have won tournaments in 2005-06.

This year, however, the Chanticleers have proved them belong mentioned among the top teams in the country, having been ranked in the top 25 for much of the 2005-06 season. Suffice it to say, they’ll make easy work of their Big South foes with the only real excitement expected to come from which Coastal Carolina player will claim the individual title.
