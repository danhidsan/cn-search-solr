      "caption":"\"Not to get all gooey, but after a long winter, a walk around Augusta National during Masters week hits for the cycle when it comes to the senses:\n\n   --Sight. Cue the cliches about the azales, dogwoods, magnolias, pines, etc. (or just get thee to the 13th hole).\n\n   --Hearing. Nothing like the roars rolling up the hills after an eagle 3. And when I say hills, I mean HILLS.\n\n   --Touch. The feel of soft pine straw under your feet? Nice.\n\n   --Smell. As Dan Jenkins would say, the aroma of biscuits and gravy on the veranda isn't a bad way to start a crisp spring morning.\n\n   --Taste. Two words: peach cobbler. And so help me, the pimento-cheese sandwiches.\" *-- Mike O'Malley, Golf Digest Executive Editor*",

But as it winds through scrub and wasteland, Pine Valley lulls you in, making every shot you hit feel like the most important shot of your life. *-- Sam Weinman, GolfDigest.com Web Editor*",

Add 18 holes with distinctly different personalities and you've taken full advantage of the land and sea to make a great, great golf course. *-- Bob Carney, Golf Digest Brand Editor*",
