      "body":"I thought this would be easy, but I'm torn. Very, very torn.  I'm more torn than Natalie Imbruglia in 1997. I'm more torn than Elmore Rudolph Torn, Jr., who goes by the stage name \"Rip.\" I'm more torn than...(*checking Wikipedia for more \"torn\" references*)...a 2013 Nigerian psychological thriller starring Ireti Doyle and Monalisa Chinda. You get me: I'm in torn-ado alley, Day vs. Spieth is a category-5 twister, and all I can hear are ominous wind chimes from the front porch of my trailer home.\n\nI can no longer hide in the basement of my own indecisiveness. This is the hardest question in golf, and the only way to answer is to stage a debate...*with myself.* \n\n\n[#image: /photos/560005d9b96e14727824c2be]||||||\n\nThe opening statement goes to Special Golf Digest Correspondent S.P. Ryan.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nGood evening. I'd like to begin by painting a portrait of my opponent as a dangerous, unstable communist, with medically diagnosed hygiene issues that have cost him dozens of relationships and at least one car.\n\nThat being said, this debate is easy -- 21-year-old Jordan Spieth won the Masters and U.S. Open, and became only the third player in history to finish fourth or better in all four majors. As my esteemed colleague Kyle Porter [pointed out](http://www.cbssports.com/golf/eye-on-golf/25273263/did-jordan-spieth-just-have-the-best-major-season-ever), Spieth, now 22, had the second-best major season in golf history. In the year's biggest tournaments, there was simply no one better than the 21 year old, who later became 22. We will remember 2015 for those victories, and for his unstoppable march to the no. 1 world ranking as a 21-slash-22-year-old.\n\nI hope you'll notice that just like Hillary Clinton in the 2015 primaries, I have not mentioned a single other candidate—either an irascible, wild-haired Senator from Vermont, or an injury-prone Aussie who didn't win his first major until the decrepit age of 27. They just *don't matter*. Did I mention Jordan Spieth was 21 years old, and is now 22?\n\nI cede the floor to my opponent, the so-called \"author\" Shane P.R., with a question: Why won't you admit that Jordan Spieth is young?\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to speak the name Ronald Reagan out loud three times. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Thank you.\n\nSecond, detractors can keep the words \"Jason Day\" out of their mouths as long as they want, but the fact remains that Day is exhibiting the kind of dominance right now that exceeds even Spieth's greatest moments. Day also has a major title, and hold on just a moment as I look up the name of the player he beat...here we go, it was...yes, it was Jordan Spieth!\n\n\nIn addition to the PGA, Day won the Farmers Insurance Open and the RBC Canadian Open, and now he's making an absolute mockery of the FedEx Cup playoffs. He will undoubtedly win this weekend's Tour Championship, trumping Spieth in money, FedEx Cup points, and wins. And I couldn't help but notice that my opponent mentioned the world rankings. Has he stopped by the OWGR lately? Check your facts, sir -- Jason Day [is the best golfer in the world.](http://www.owgr.com)\n\nIn conclusion, Ronald Reagan.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nIs there a reason my opponent isn't wearing an Augusta National pin on his lapel? Does he not love golf? Personally, I'm happy to wear my pin, and to shout my love of this great game to the entire world. And by \"entire world,\" I mean America.\n\nSince we're discussing minor victories, I'd like to point out that Spieth also prevailed at the Valspar and the John Deere Classic this season. He's missed exactly four cuts, and notched 14 top-ten finishes.\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nDay has cracked the top 10 an even 10 times, in fewer tournaments. He's only missed two cuts, and he has more overall wins than Spieth. And I would urge all Americans to ask themselves a very simple question when they sit down at their kitchen tables tonight: Is Jordan Spieth's game better off today than it was two months ago? Is Jason Day's?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nI'd like to tell the story of a seven-year-old child who approached me at the Barclays this year. He cried a single tear, and he told me he was worried for his family. The boy's name was Little Bobby Heartland-Values, and he said, \"Mr. Ryan, what does it mean if a foreigner wins Player of the Year? Does that mean America dies?\" And I'm ashamed to say I couldn't answer him, my friends. But I'd urge you to contemplate Bobby's words. *Does America die?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nThat's just more of the same old anti-immigrant rhetoric spewed by pro-Spieth zealots. America didn't die last year when Rory McIlroy won.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\n*Didn't it?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nYou have to stop doing that.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\n*Do I?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nLook, let's not get distracted. Jason Day is the best golfer in the world, he has more tournament victories than Spieth, he won a major, and he's about to win the PGA Tour's top prize. Period.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nWhen a player wins the Masters and the U.S. Open in the same year -- and joins the likes of Tiger and Hogan to become just the sixth player to do so -- the only way he doesn't win Player of the Year is if somebody else wins the British and PGA. Nobody else did that. Spieth is your man. End of discussion.\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nI made a vow not to go dirty in this campaign, but I think the American people deserve an answer: How do you respond to accusations made by respectable outlets that your player choked at the world's most famous course?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nSCURRILOUS LIBEL! How do you respond to my claim, that I'm making up right now, that your player faked vertigo to generate sympathy?\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nHOW DARE YOU! How do you respond to PGA Tour sources who say with absolute certainty that Spieth is a dumpster diving vegan who keeps a portrait of Martha Burk in his bedroom?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nHOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE GHOST OF RONALD REAGAN, WHO SAID THAT—\n\n----\n\nIt devolved from there—the rest is unprintable, and totally unhelpful. I'm full of self-loathing, and I think our political system is broken.\n\nBob Harig [pointed out](http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/13690949/trying-clear-player-year-question-jordan-spieth-jason-day) that every two-time major winner has also won Player of the Year, but so has every five-time winner. Something's gotta give, and I don't just mean our collective sanity. Will the American voters pick Spieth? Will Day get the benefit of the doubt for owning the PGA Tour all year? Is Tiger done? There's so much left to be decided, and I get the feeling it won't feel decided even after it's decided. Which is why I feel decidedly undecided. Thank you, and may God bless this great sport of golf.\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55e5c1c4b91019d74c997df9]||||||\n\n\n",

And at No. 4 in the current standings (the top 5 all control their own destiny), he has about as good of a chance as anyone to take home golf's biggest payday again.\n\n[#iframe: //embed.gettyimages.com/embed/486322410?et=I6wv87pIQDZr5Z2VrlpPyw&viewMoreLink=on&sig=zMA1vW7cJLBUlX-o1h56pxwZh7prjECmdify7xAecIo=](594x395)|||\n\n\nBut even someone as good as Stenson, currently No. 6 in the Official World Golf Ranking, can be awed by the golf being played around him, most notably by new No. 1 Jason Day. When asked to assess his chances of winning the Tour Championship on Tuesday, the humorous Swede offered this response:\n\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/PGATOUR/status/646366815308746752]\n\n\nWe think he's talking about the current top three players in the world -- Day, Jordan Spieth, and Rory McIlroy -- but he could also be referring to World Nos. 4 and 5, Bubba Watson and Rickie Fowler, who beat Stenson by one at the BMW Championship two weeks ago, with that 330 remark. Either way, point taken. These days, it's only getting tougher to win on tour.",

But if there's one person who actually knows what Woods is going through, it's fellow golfer Graham DeLaet.\n\nOn Monday, DeLaet took to Twitter to talk about Tiger's microdiscectomy, a procedure the Canadian underwent in 2011:\n\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/GrahamDeLaet/status/646013575404761088]\n\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/GrahamDeLaet/status/646013706061541376]\n\nWhen someone asked DeLaet why golfers get hurt, here was his response:\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/GrahamDeLaet/status/646019322494627841]\n\nAnd here's what DeLaet said at the Sony Open in 2012 after the operation essentially wiped out his entire 2011 season:\n\n\"I had a herniated disk over to the right, so they go in and shave off a piece of that to alleviate the pinch on the nerve. I had terrible pain in my right leg. Yeah, it was not fun. I'm glad it's all over and I'm feeling great now.\"\n\nDeLaet has had his highs since then (most notably his strong play at the 2013 Presidents Cup), but he's also missed a lot more time due to neck and thumb injuries. \n\n\"The frustrating part of being injured is waiting,\" DeLaet said in January after another extended break. \"The recovery from any injury is always slower than you’d like.\"\n\nAt least, for Tiger this time, with the Masters still more than six months away, he won't be missing much while he waits.\n\n",

      "body":"\"How can Jordan Spieth miss a cut and still move to no. 1? How can Rory take it back in a bye week? The world rankings are a joke!\"\n\nIf you've heard somebody else say this recently, and you agreed, slap yourself. If *you've* said it, slap yourself harder. And if you finish reading this article and haven't seen the light, just keep slapping yourself until 2016, read it again, and repeat.\n\nMy position is simple: The OWGR (Official World Golf Rankings) is a terrific system that has proven incredibly adept at identifying the world's best golfers, and nobody has ever formulated a reasonable argument against it—much less an alternative.\n\nIn other words, if you don't \"get\" it, it's because you haven't spent any time trying to understand the system. You are practicing something called \"willful ignorance,\" and even though willful ignorance has essentially become a national sport, you should not be proud. You should not pat yourself on the back as you use an aberration to denigrate what is a valid, and I would even say *brilliant*, system. If you use Spieth's rise to slander the OWGR, you're not demonstrably different than a rube who points at a snowflake and says, \"see? Global warming is fake!\"\n\nWe're going to talk about the OWGR, and we're going to talk about Jordan Spieth ascending to the top spot despite a missed cut, and we're going to talk about history. But first, I'd like to introduce a couple of easy exercises. Number one: I'm going to list the top five players in the world by OWGR, and you're going to tell me if that ranking makes sense based on the golf you've watched over the past two years:\n\n1. Rory McIlroy\n2. Jordan Spieth\n3. Jason Day\n4. Bubba Watson\n5. Rickie Fowler\n\nThose five players have won six of the last eight majors, a Players Championship, a BMW PGA Championship, four of the past seven WGCs, the last two FedExCup playoff tournaments, and a slew of smaller PGA Tour and European Tour events. These are, indisputably, the best five players in the world, which means that the OWGR nailed it. Even if you don't like math, you can appreciate this. You can content yourself with the clear, undeniable evidence: The system works! It correctly ranks the world's best players! The result vindicates the process! Hooray! We can move on to demanding a Walker Cup task force!\n\nExercise two: If you *are* interested in the math, and you've taken the time to insult the OWGR lately, I'll give you a moment to put your money where your mouth is. Please, devise a superior system that A) Yields the results we already have; B) Is easy to understand without being laughably ineffective; C) Doesn't involve knocking Jordan Spieth down to 147th place after one missed cut.\n\nBecause that's the rub—ranking golfers is hard, whether pundits want to admit it or not. How do you weight bigger tournaments, with superior fields, against the weaker events? How far do you go back before the results are judged irrelevant? How do you incorporate the (100% necessary) recency bias, so Jack Nicklaus isn't the world's no.1 golfer? What are the punishments for missing a cut, and what are the rewards for an outright win?\n\nThere's a lot to consider, but—lucky us—the OWGR has already considered it. This is the point where I explain how the system functions, but if you want to read it from the horse's mouth—which you should, if you plan on slamming it anytime soon—go [here](http://www.owgr.com/about). I'm just giving you the cliff notes.\n\n__1.__ The OWGR uses two years, or 104 weeks, worth of results.\n\n__2.__ Each player earns points based on how he finishes in a tournament. He earns more points for a higher finish.\n\n__3.__ If a tournament field is strong, total points rise. If a field is weak, total points fall. This next sentence will be the most complicated I write: There's a world rating chart (taking into account the quality of players) and a home rating chart (taking into account the number of quality players from the home tour), and those numbers are combined into a \"strength of field\" rating. After that, the OWGR has a handy guide telling them exactly how many points each finisher should get.\n\n__4.__ The points a player earns in a tournament are counted, in full, for 13 weeks. After that, the value decreases by about 1.09 percent per week for the remaining 91 weeks, diminishing gradually until the 105th week, when it vanishes into the fog of time and is counted no more. Does that create some complicated math? Absolutely. Is it difficult to understand? Absolutely not.\n\n__5.__ Each player's total points are added, divided by his total events played, and then, voila, world rankings!\n\nMaybe you read all that and said, \"You know what? This is still pretty complicated.\"\n\nI would agree. It *is* complicated. But it's beautifully complicated, the way some things have to be beautifully complicated in order to function accurately. If we built our roads or buildings or airplanes or cars without obeying some pretty knotty mathematical formulas, we'd live in a state of constant ruin. I'm not saying world rankings are as important as our infrastructure, but they do require a bit of complexity.\n\nAnyone who claims there's a simple solution is selling you snake oil. Inventing a world rankings system in an individual sport without easy-to-define wins or losses is a hard problem, and hard problems don't have easy answers. That's why every complaint you read about the OWGR is followed by half-cocked, impractical solutions, or, more often, no solutions at all.\n\nNow we return to the Spieth Paradox. How can someone miss a cut and still overtake another player for the top spot in the world? Well, it's certainly not common, but occasionally strange things happen, and they give ammo to the OWGR's detractors. So let's ask ourselves: Why *do* strange things happen?\n\nJordan Spieth earned zero points for his missed cut at the Deutsche Bank, while Rory McIlroy earned 3.21 points for his T-29 finish. That's a net gain of 3.21 for Rory. But as we saw above, each week also knocks one event into the fog of time for each player, and it reduces the value of each event that didn't take place in the last 13 weeks by about 1.09 percent. You know which events *didn't* happen in the past 13 weeks? Rory's wins at the 2014 majors, along with his last two WGC victories. You know which events *did* happen in the past 13 weeks? Spieth's win at the U.S. Open and the John Deere and his fourth-place finish at the British. For now, those events count more, while Rory's best accomplishments are worth less all the time—as they should be. Amidst those calculations, Spieth gained enough points to offset the Deutsche Bank loss.\n\nAll that being said, this situation is still incredibly rare. As rare as possible, in fact—Spieth is [the only player to become no. 1 after a cut](%22https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/641032728910032896) since the OWGR began. And after the off week, Rory jumped back ahead of Spieth by the closest margin ever—another rarity.\n\nThat, to me, is a sign of the OWGR's health, not its weakness; it's the odd exception that proves the rule. The exciting Spieth v. Rory race has produced the perfect storm of narrow margins, and they'll probably flip a few more times before a clear winner emerges. We should be giving the rankings a standing ovation, because they're *perfectly* reflecting the national debate—who's the superior golfer? There's no consensus, and that uncertainty is mirrored by the OWGR. Looked at from a certain angle, isn't it pretty incredible that the system seems to understand that we're witnessing a historical rivalry?\n\nSpeaking of history, the OWGR was first published before the Masters in 1986, but Mark McCormack—sports agent, Yale Law grad, U.S. Army vet, and a generally brilliant guy who also helped invent tennis' world rankings—had been publishing rankings based on his own complex system, the OWGR's precursor, since 1968. And unlike many governing bodies in golf, the OWGR are not deaf to criticism or immune to self-improvement. Since the beginning, the rankings have undergone various adjustments and tweaks, evolving until it became the elegant, misunderstood system we know today. The flaws have been addressed, and addressed again, and again, to the point of near perfection.\n\n\nI've just spent a lot of words defending the OWGR, but in reality, I only need these: The proof is in the pudding. The funny thing about all the complaints is that we constantly attack the system, but we never seem to attack the actual rankings—they're too good. This is the rare case when the people in charge know exactly what they're doing, and instead of blindly throwing rocks at something we don't understand, maybe we should step back and appreciate the product. Plainly put, the damn thing works.\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55f07aedb91019d74c99a335]||||||\n\n\n",

But when the writers get their vote, look for the scribes to cling to Jordan Spieth having done something in the majors only Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have done: never finish worse than T-4.  \n\n[#iframe: //embed.gettyimages.com/embed/484269544?et=1OkR2QX2RidFnseuaCJAjg&viewMoreLink=on&sig=VK2sy6Cv-zLhEj9ozq4lXhyhR8vRhx09l-bMuP9Bels=](594x395)|||\n\n— Will Tim Finchem at least hint that maybe this playoff timing needs re-thinking? Most likely not. But if this is indeed the 68-year-old Commissioner's last Tour Championship as a non-lame duck leader, he could do the right thing and suggest at his \"State of the Tour\" press conference that his organization is considering trying to end the \"playoffs\" a little sooner. But if this was match play, football wins 9&8 in the hearts and minds of Americans. The ratings back that up, as does the lack of national buzz over the amazing playoff run by Jason Day.\n\n— Will this be the last time we see East Lake as we know it? The Atlanta golf community has been hearing big rumblings about East Lake founder Tom Cousins wanting to liven up his Donald Ross-designed and Rees Jones-renovated layout. Most notably, Cousins is said to want to switch the nines so that a splendid par-5 decides the Tour Championship, instead of a lackluster par 3. He also wants to make the par-3 sixth a pronounced island green. The PGA Tour has not signed off on any of the changes. So meetings are scheduled, great minds and egos will be chiming in, and we should have answers by week's end.\n\n__The Tour Championship__\n\nThe PGA Tour's advance man on site at East Lake, Mark Dusbabek, reports that in his ten years preparing the course, superintendent Ralph Kepple has never had it looking better. Dusbabek says the greens will roll in 12-12.5 on the Stimpmeter range, the rough is a more stout 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 inch range. That doesn't sound like much until you remember it's wiry Bermuda grass.\n\nDusbabek says weather permitting, to look for a more lively 18th hole Sunday hole location in the front of the green, with the tee moved forward a bit. \n\nThe Tour Championship presented by Coca-Cola starts Thursday on Golf Channel at 1 pm ET. Weekend coverage is split between Golf Channel and NBC.\n\n__Elsewhere…__\n\nWhile the LPGA Tour disappears until surfacing in Malaysia next month, the Ladies European Tour tees up at Golf De Chantaco in the LaCoste Ladies French Open.

      "body":"A day after she [drew the ire of the golf world for her actions in a Sunday fourballs match in the Solheim Cup](http://www.golfdigest.com/story/conceded-putt-drama-at-solheim-anger-tears-and-a-match-ending-in-controversy), Norway's Suzann Pettersen nobly acknowledged her mistake [in a long, plaintive post on Instagram](https://instagram.com/p/74r3eQOVA4/).\n\nPlaying alongside Charley Hull in a morning match against Allison Lee and Brittany Lincicome, Pettersen controversially said Lee's short putt on the 17th green wasn't good after Lee had picked it up. The assumption from her teammate and even rules officials was that the putt was conceded, but Pettersen told officials they had never said so. The sequence directly led to a win in the match, and while it was clearly within the rules of golf, many, most notably U.S. captain Juli Inkster, said it was outside of the spirit of the game. \n\nPettersen acknowledged as much in her Monday post, and said she apologized directly to Inkster before leaving Germany. \"I hope in time the U.S. team will forgive me and know that I have learned a valuable lesson about what is truly important in this great game of golf which has given me so much in my life,\" Pettersen wrote. \n\nThe regret of her actions was compounded by the Europeans squandering a four-point lead to lose the Solheim Cup.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55ffe8e1b96e14727824c29e]||||||\n\n\nThe full text of Pettersen's post is below.\n\n\"I've never felt more gutted and truly sad about what went down Sunday on the 17th at the Solheim Cup. \n\n\"I am so sorry for not thinking about the bigger picture in the heat of the battle and competition. I was trying my hardest for my team and put the single match and the point that could be earned ahead of sportsmanship and the game of golf itself! I feel like I let my team down and I am sorry.\n\n\"To the U.S. team, you guys have a great leader in Juli , who I've always looked up to and respect so much. Knowing I need to make things 'right,' I had a face to face chat with her before leaving Germany this morning to tell her in person how \n\n\"I really feel about all of this. I wanted her also to know that I am sorry.\nI hope in time the U.S. team will forgive me and know that I have learned a valuable lesson about what is truly important in this great game of golf which has given me so much in my life.\n\n\"To the fans of golf who watched the competition on TV, I am sorry for the way I carried myself. I can be so much better and being an ambassador for this great game means a lot to me.\n\n\"The Solheim Cup has been a huge part of my career. I wish I could change Sunday for many reasons. Unfortunately I can't. \n\n\"This week I want to push forward toward another opportunity to earn the Solheim Cup back for Europe in the right way. And I want to work hard to earn back your belief in me as someone who plays hard, plays fair and plays the great game of golf the right way.\"",

The day before, the PGA of America had cancelled this year’s Grand Slam of Golf, which had been scheduled to be played at Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles in October, but was moved from that venue after Trump’s controversial comments about Mexican immigrants in July, which caused several corporations to disassociate from him. Trump, 69, seemed unbothered by the news, he and his spokesman pointing out that he still has three years on his contract to host the event, and that the decision to move the venue had allowed time to remove a waterfall on the course.* \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55adb1f7add713143b447dd4]||||||\n\n\n__You’ve become a major player in golf. How would you compare the way you’ve reached that station to how you’ve become a major political player in your run for  President?__\n\nI think very different in one way, and very similar in another. My golf is very high end. Great locations, great courses, highly acclaimed. And the word quality is important. I get things done, but I like to say I get it done with superb quality. I have locations that are good for many other things. So I’m not necessarily stuck in the world of golf. But I choose to be. But I have land that is so valuable, that if I ever wanted to do housing on it, as an example, but I just don’t choose to do that.\n\n\nFor government, you have to do it differently, but I think the quality of what we would do would be much better. Our infrastructure has to be rebuilt. Our bridges are literally crumbling. They need work and nobody is doing anything. Our roads, our schools, our airports. So I think I’d start a process where we would have a much higher quality at a much lesser cost. I think there would be far better management. You look at the vets, how badly they’ve been treated. Reports have come out that 300,000 vets have died waiting to get into the Veteran’s administration.\n\nIt’s probably at the worst point it’s ever been. So I think the management of the country would be much better. And I think I get great credit for management, not only for my golf courses but the way I manage the company.\n\nI respect lean and mean, but I don’t think my style is lean and mean. I spend more money than I would have to. But I like to see it perfect. And I see a lot of people who spend a lot of money and don’t make it perfect, and that’s the worst of all combinations.\n\nThere is tremendous fat in government.  A lot can be cut. We have to, because look at the budget deficits that we have. Look at the money that we owe. We owe $19 trillion. That’s hard to believe. That’s a big job when you think of it.\n\nBut one thing about government, you have to manage, but you also have to manage with a heart. You need heart. In golf you don’t have to manage with heart. Or in business you don’t necessarily have to manage with heart. But in government you do have to manage with heart. And I understand that.\n \n__What have you learned from the presidential experience?__\n\nWell, I had no idea it would be this big, number one. Because when you look at what’s happened in terms of the level of popularity and the polls, I didn’t think it would be that fast. And once I announced it was like a rocket ship. Nobody thought I was going to run, and once I announced, it’s gone very fast.\n\nNumber two, it’s a nasty business. It’s nasty. I find great dishonesty. Sort of the opposite of golf, I find great dishonesty in the world of politics.\n \n__Does it give you hesitancy in terms of what you’ve gotten into?__\n\nNo. If anything, I’m much more glad I did it now. It’s what I say -- make America great again. Although that first two weeks was pretty rough. When I first came out with the whole thing on illegal immigration, I was getting massive [criticism]. Rough even in the sense of the golf world reaction.\n \n__How did you react when golf organizations distanced themselves when you made your comments about Mexican immigrants?__\n\nWell, I was disappointed in them. I was little disappointed because I didn’t think it was necessary. But at the same time I know it’s part of a process. And I have great respect for Pete Bevacqua, Mike Davis, Tim Finchem.  And I understand that the statements I made were very incendiary. And they had to be made, because they turned out to be true. And there was a period of one month where there was a lot of what I call incoming. Golf was very mild in comparison.  And I understood the golf. I got it. I understood it.\n\nAnd those golf leaders, I believe, have seen that what I was saying was right, and I’ve gotten to No. 1 in all the polls, which is telling you that the country thinks I’m right. I can’t speak for them [the golf leaders], but I feel they’re much more comfortable.\n \n __You have Mexican immigrants who work for you on your golf courses and other properties. How would you act if you learned some of them were in this country illegally?__\n\nWell, we don’t have that. And I’m very careful about that. And I’m careful for a number of reasons. No. 1) because I don’t believe in it, and No. 2) I’m careful because I happen to be running for President. You can never be 100 percent sure, but we check very carefully.\n\nI have a great relationship with the Mexican people. I’ve employed tens of thousands of Hispanics over the years, and I have a great relationship, and I think in the election, I will actually win the Hispanic vote.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55ec28ec4759c60c08240d62]||||||\n\n\nBut we wouldn’t have them working for us for long. We would not have that worker. A thing like that can happen. Don’t forget that there are 11 million here illegally, maybe as many as 30 million, nobody really knows, so things can happen where somebody gets in. But if we find there is somebody who is here illegally, we won’t hire them. We would start by letting them go, and secondly we may inform the authorities, but the most important thing, we are not hiring the illegals.\n \n__Who’s the best politician golfer you’ve played with?__\n\nInteresting, but I’ve never played with a great politician golfer. I’ve played with guys who are OK, they are 8s and 9s but not great. And I understand that, from being a politician for three months. I’m in the club championship at my club at Bedminster next week and I haven’t played in three and a half weeks. I’m not going in there with great gusto, although there is no pressure on me, because everyone over there at Bedminster has been practicing all day long. I haven’t picked up a club.\n\nI played with John Boehner, and he’s a good golfer, I’d say he’s an 8 or a 9 handicap. I never played with Dan Quayle, who was a good golfer. But it’s funny, in the world of politics, it’s hard to play a lot of golf.\n \n__Who has been your favorite golfing president?__\n\nIt was before my time, by a lot, but Eisenhower seems to be the guy who loved golf more than anybody else. You could say Ford was very involved, and Obama is very much involved, and Clinton loves it to this day. But of all the presidents the one who seemed to love golf the most was Dwight Eisenhower.\n \n__Did you know he played 800 times in two terms?__\n\nWow, that’s a lot of golf.\n \n__Do you think playing golf can help a president do his job?__\n\nWell, I think you have to have a little moderation, because it’s a pretty busy job.\n\nBut I do think this: the beauty of golf is that you develop relationships, and you can make deals on a golf course. And I’ve often said that I don’t mind that Obama plays a lot of golf. He should play with people who can help the country, like if he played more with Boehner, and if he played more with maybe foreign leaders, it would be a wonderful thing. Many of the foreign leaders play golf and love golf.\n\nAnd you get to know people, you get to know them better on a golf course than anywhere else. I’ve said it many times, so many of the deals I’ve made are because of golf. Not because I play well or somebody else played well. It’s because you develop a camaraderie with people on a golf course that you could never develop over lunch or dinner. And some of my deals were made because I developed a relationship on a golf course.\n \n__What about the idea of golf helping a President have a clear mind?__\n\nLess so, but certainly that’s something. The great thing about golf is that you go in, you have a hundred things that you are thinking about and all of a sudden all you want to do is properly hit the little white ball. It becomes everything. So I don’t think of it that way, but the answer is yes.\n \n__What’s your experience with Bill Clinton as a golfer?__\n\nWe’ve played a number of times. We have very different games. By the way, he doesn’t cheat. He will drop a ball, but he doesn’t make any bones about it. If he misses a shot -- he doesn’t get to play very much -- so he’ll drop a ball and hit a second shot. But he’s not saying he got a par if he didn’t get a par. It’s not like he’s trying to hide anything. I think he’s been treated unfairly.\n \n__If Hilary were to play, what kind of golfer do you think she would be?__\n\nShe certainly is a competitive person, and I think she’d be trying very hard. I don’t know that she plays, but she’d certainly be trying very hard.\n \n__Megyn Kelly offers to bury the hatchet with a round of golf. Would you accept?__\n\nAbsolutely. Sure. Why not?\n \n__What’s your standard golf bet?__\n\nI’m not a big bettor. I’ve had bets that were for a lot. Once I was in China, and a group of very wealthy Chinese businessmen, we were playing at course, one of those that it’s millions to get in. It was a group of four guys who always play together, and one of them wasn’t there, so I was the fourth, and they wanted to play for $100,000 a hole. And it wasn’t that they were good players, one said he got 20 strokes, one said he got 15, and I had never seen them play. And I was saying to myself, wouldn’t I feel stupid wiring back home for money telling my financial officers, “Hey, I just lost a million dollars playing golf,” and I’d never seen these guys play. So it was one of the few times where I said, I’ll pass. I always tell my people, watch your pennies because it’s important.\n\nI don’t play for much money. We’ll play for $10, maybe $100 nassaus, usually. Pretty much that’s it. I don’t get a thrill out of gambling at golf.\n \n__If you ran golf, what would you change?__\n\nI’ve felt strongly that golf should be an aspirational game. It shouldn’t be a game for all strata of society. It should be something that you aspire to. And I think golf got away from that. And by getting away from it, it actually hurt golf.\n \n__In Scotland, where golf began and spread among the populace, it’s long been a game for all strata. Why in your opinion does that formula not work now?__\n\nI think that formula does work in terms of the daily fee and public courses. I have a course in Los Angeles that is tremendously successful. It’s a great course, but it’s also on the Pacific Ocean. Trump Ferry Point, from 6:30 to late afternoon, foursomes are just going out. Never have an empty slot. Public golf does work if you have a really good course in a really good location.\n \n__But those are expensive courses. What about municipal’s like Cobb’s Creek in Philadelphia, where you yourself first began to play game seriously paying $10-$15 a round?__\n\nI used to play for even less than that at other public courses. I think those entry points are OK. But I see so much emphasis on getting young people to play the game, and once they get a little bit older they’ll never play. But once they become successful, they will be able to play. And they’ll aspire to play. So it’s good to give them a touch at the beginning, but I just think that you know, golf is not an inexpensive game, whether we like it or not. I just think for golf to be truly successful, it’s got to be more of an aspirational game then they are talking about right now.\n \n__How’s your own golf?__\n\nIt’s hard to believe, but I think I’m a better golfer today than I was many years ago. I think I know the game better. My putting has always been good. I don’t hit a lot of bad shots. Part of the beauty of golf is for me to be able to say at my age that I can be a better golfer than I was 20 years. And I think that’s a great thing for people to see. Because how many sports can you be better as you get older? Now, there will be a point where I fall of the ledge. And it will be, well, that’s the end of that. It happens.\n \n__What will happen to your business if you become president?__\n\nIt will be run by my children, and my executives. My children have become very good at what they are doing. It’s a very big business, but they will be able to run it. And I think they’d run it very well.\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55a5470c1bedf5e91fc0a7be]||||||\n\n\n",
