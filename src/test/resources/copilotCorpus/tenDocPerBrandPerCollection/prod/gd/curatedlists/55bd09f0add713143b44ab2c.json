      "body":"The Chicagoland area is known for its stout tournament tests, including Conway Farms -- the venue for this week's BMW Championship. \n\nThe public course selections in the area are just as worthy of attention. Cog Hill's Dubsdread gets most of the press as a former tour venue and potential U.S. Open site, but after an extensive four-year renovation, Mistwood Golf Club deserves a look. Thanks to an attractive fall special, you both can take the Ray Hearn design's measure and improve your game in the process. \n\nBook a tee time Monday through Thursday and for $150 you'll get 18 holes *plus* a one-hour session on a TrackMan system with either an instructor or expert clubfitter in Mistwood's new 5,000-sqft Performance Center. \n\nIf you're ambitious --- and you get an early first tee time -- you can beat the faltering daylight and catch 18 holes at both Dubsdread and Mistwood in the same day. The courses are just 13 miles apart in the Southwest Chicagoland suburbs.  \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[__WATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS__](http://video.golfdigest.com/)\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55f2f3f44759c60c08242a43]||||||\n\n\n",

Gatlinburg Golf Course (*pictured above*), just outside the Tennessee entrances to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, doesn't disappoint. \n\nThe course is like a roller coaster on the back nine, which is fitting because these are the holes that run closest to the neighboring Dollywood theme park. (You will hear the whistle from Dollywood's narrow-gauge steam train throughout the back side.) \n\nThe most memorable hole is No. 12 (Sky Hi), a par 3 with a hang-time-inducing 200-foot drop from tee to green. A helpful sign explains how to play it. From the 194-yard back tees, for example, you'll want to hit your 165-yard club. \n\nThough the front nine is not quite as dramatic, there is plenty to like. The first tee sends you down a severe incline to a wide fairway, and after that you'll make your way through gently rolling hills and a pleasing mix of long and short holes. Views of the Smoky Mountains abound.\n\nGatlinburg Golf Course was built in 1955 and was renovated most recently in 2007 by architect Bob Cupp. In 2009, Golf Digest named it the No. 1 municipal course in Tennessee. I haven't played them all, but that seems like a fair assessment to me. The peak-season green fee: $60, including cart. \n\n[Related: Tennessee: Best In State Rankings](http://www.golfdigest.com/story/tennessee-best-in-state-rankings)\n\n----------\n\n[__WATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS__](http://video.golfdigest.com/)\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55bb792db01eefe207f8e9b5]||||||\n\n\n",

But the popular winter resort area has an alter ego: In the summer it's one of the prettiest, most serene places on Earth, and home to some ear-popping mountain golf. The area's best-kept secret is the private, eco-friendly Snowmass Club (*pictured above*), which was meticulously redesigned by Jim Engh in 2004 and offers one of the greatest up-and-down rounds a golfer can face. (The club has limited tee times for the public for $185, cart included.) \n\nBuilt to reward precision and imagination, the par-72, 7,008-yard layout has 400 feet of elevation changes and is 8,000 feet above sea level at its lowest point. The thin-air distance boost, about 10 to 15 percent for a well-struck shot, comes in handy on holes like the 278-yard sixth, a downhill par 3 with a very large green. The tee shot of the day is on the majestic 18th. No matter the skill level, every player should take a rip from the elevated back tee just to watch the ball descend more than 100 feet into the fairway. The uphill holes, such as the par-3 12th, test your club selection as much as they do your swing (not to mention make you glad you took a cart). Engh's signature deep bunkers with flat bottoms can be found on practically every hole, but the biggest hazard at Snowmass is distraction. Amazing views of the Rocky Mountains and long-range glimpses of elk, moose and the occasional bear provide great excuses for a bad shot.\n\n[Related: Colorado: Best In State Rankings](http://www.golfdigest.com/story/colorado-best-in-state-rankings) \n\n----------\n\n[__WATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS__](http://video.golfdigest.com/)\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55ba83acb01eefe207f8e9a6]||||||\n\n\n",

Golf Digest demoted it to the Fifth Ten back in the early 1970s, saying, \"It's not surprising that good players might find Cypress Point wanting: it has several easy holes and a weak finisher.\" Our panel has since changed its collective opinion. In the 2000s, member Sandy Tatum, the former USGA president who christened Cypress Point as the Sistine Chapel of golf, convinced the club not to combat technology by adding new back tees, but instead make a statement by celebrating its original architecture. So Cypress remains timeless, if short, its charm helped in part by superintendent Jeff Markow, who re-established Mackenzie's unique bunkering with the help of old photographs.\n\n*100 Greatest History: Ranked since 1966.

A major tournament site since 1949, it has undergone a succession of remodelings and has improved with every session. Its par-3 17th is the most prominent example. It was shifted to a new location in 1986, to precede a whole new 18th hole. (The original 17th is now the 13th.) Ten years later, the 17th green was moved away from a lakefront to a spot atop a hill, but after Tiger Woods' first (of two) PGA Championship victories on the course, the green was moved back to the water's edge, where it remains today. For the 2012 Ryder Cup, consulting architect Rees Jones created an entirely new par-4 15th, with a pond along both fairway and green to pose risks and rewards.

Chensoff decided to gamble, instructing Hurdzan-Fry to design the most unique course in south Florida despite a dead flat site. They responded by piling up fill from ponds to form ridge lines up to 58 feet, then planted them with mature oaks, pines and sabal palms. Calusa Pines is the Shadow Creek of The South, with far more sandy waste areas. It also sports perhaps the firmest, fastest Bermuda fairways and greens in Florida. ",
