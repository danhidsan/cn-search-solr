His looks last week at the BMW Championship on the way to yet another victory were steps in the right direction, but were still off the mark. This collar is way too small for a guy of Day's size. Sure, smaller collars are a bit trendier and can look more modern, but go too small and you'll look like your shopping in the boys department.\n\n[Adidas Golf](http://adidasgolf.com/)",

Blue-on-blue combos feel much more modern than anything in the khaki family and is about an easy of an update you can work into your game with clothes you've probably already got in your wardrobe.\n\n[Under Armour](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/)",

Anytime you turn up the wattage on your wardrobe, balance becomes increasingly important. A good guideline is to stick to white accessories with this look as black shoes, belts and hats can look a little balky with bright colors (See: Bubba Watson).\n\n[Under Armour](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/)",

Beards are about balance -- natural, yet still clean and under control. Use clippers to trim around the cheeks and neckline and avoid razor sharp lines of demarcation.

      "body":"*(Editor's note: Yogi Berra passed away on Sept. 22, 2015. This is a Q&A with the Yankees legend that ran in the April 2010 issue of Golf Digest.)*\n\nLawrence Peter \"Yogi\" Berra, 84, played in 14 World Series with the Yankees, and won 10. Both are a record. Berra and his wife, Carmen, live in New Jersey and recently celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary. For once telling reporters, \"I'm afraid to pick up the phone, someone might be on the other end,\" Fred Couples is often referred to as the Yogi Berra of golf. Berra still plays four days a week and he says it's fair to compare a caddie to being a catcher.\n\n\n\n __What was your first memory of golf?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I guess that's when I got to the big leagues. After my first season I played with Stan Musial, Red Schoendienst and Joe Medwick in St. Louis.\n\n\n\n __How was Stan's golf game?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n He was good. Schoendienst and Medwick were also very good players. Mickey Mantle was a very good golfer, but we weren't allowed to play golf during the season, only at spring training. Casey Stengel said we could play if we had the day off or something. As soon as the season started, \"Pack 'em up,\" he'd say. \"And if we catch you out there playing golf, it will cost you 200 bucks.\" And 200 bucks was a lot of money back then.\n\n\n\n __What was your first annual salary when you came up to the big leagues?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n $5,000.\n\n\n\n __This year you served as the first Classic Ambassador of the Bob Hope Classic. Did you ever play with Bob Hope?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oh, yeah. When I first played in it. I played with him and with President Ford. It was a great honor to be asked to represent Bob Hope.\n\n\n\n __Did you ever see President Ford hit anybody in the gallery?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n No, I didn't. He was a pretty good golfer. He was a wonderful man. He did a lot for charity.\n\n\n\n __In years of playing in pro-ams, did you ever hit a member of the gallery?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Not that I know of. If I did, I didn't hurt 'em.\n\n\n\n __What do you love about the Palm Springs area?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Heck, it's beautiful out there. And you have all of those courses to choose from.\n\n\n\n __What's your favorite U.S. city?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I liked St. Louis, when they were in the American League, because that was going home. I had all my family and friends there. Detroit was another good one -- it was a good ballpark to hit in.\n\n\n\n __Do you wish you could've had a career hitting at the new Yankee Stadium?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I would take my chances there.\n\n\n\n __You might have made more than $5,000 per year.__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Maybe. I don't know.\n\n\n\n __If you weren't a baseball player, what would have been your career of choice?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Probably working in a brickyard.\n\n\n\n __You've seen a lot of changes in the airline industry. What's your biggest complaint about getting on a plane today?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It's not that bad. I'm automatic because I have this new knee. I tell them that I'm going to go right through and that I'm going to ring the alarm. Then I go to the corner so they can check me out.\n\n\n\n __Have you ever done an annual buddies trip?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I get asked a lot, but I have so many charity events ... No kidding. Almost every Monday I have a charity thing. I like that. I do. I like the ones where we play the ball of the longest hitter.\n\n\n\n __If I gave you a choice between Pebble Beach, Pinehurst or Pine Valley, where would you choose to play?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pine Valley, because it's right up here where we live. That's a beautiful course but you got to stay out of the traps and the woods.\n\n\n\n __When you're around tour pros, what's the most common question you get asked?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It depends. A lot of them are baseball fans. I enjoy playing with them. I hope they enjoy playing with me, but I might ruin their game.\n\n\n\n __Are you a member at a club?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Montclair Country Club in New Jersey. They have 36 holes, which is nice, because you can take your pick.\n\n\n\n __How many rounds do you get in per week?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I have a sore back. I can get in three or four times per week, but I can't play four days in a row or I would've stayed playing in the Bob Hope.\n\n\n\n __What was your lowest handicap?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I was a 10 handicap at one time.\n\n\n\n __Do you remember a best round?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It was a 76. I should remember where, but I don't.\n\n\n\n __Do you have any hole-in-ones?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n One, but it was in my own golf tournament, and that doesn't count. I have a tournament to benefit my museum and I played the same hole with every group. I hit enough balls and one went in.\n\n\n\n __Who's in your ideal foursome, dead or alive?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  I have a lot of people. No kidding. I don't care who I play with. I really don't. I go out to have fun. If I shoot good -- fine. If I don't -- tough luck. I enjoy it. It's a good exercise. I ride a cart but I like to walk a little bit, too. With this new knee I don't mind the hills, as long as I don't hit a ball up there.\n\n\n\n __Is there a course you've never played but that you'd still like to play?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I've played a lot of good courses: Pinehurst, Merion. I played golf in Ireland at Lahinch and all of those places. Heck, I played Jack's course, Memorial, with Gil Hodges when it first opened, but I've never played the Old Course at St. Andrews.\n\n\n\n __Are you a bigger fan of Jack or Arnold?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I'm a fan of all of them. Arnold and Jack are both great guys.\n\n\n\n __Which one did you follow more?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I didn't know much about golf growing up. I got to know them when I started playing the game. I've never had Jack as a partner. I've had Arnold as a partner a couple times. I've had Fred Couples as a partner. It's amazing they put up with us.\n\n\n\n __If Tiger and Phil were in the final pairing of the Masters, which one would you root for?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I'd like to see a good match. That's too tough to choose.\n\n\n\n __Tiger is chasing Jack's record of 18 majors and Derek Jeter is chasing your record of 10 championships. Tiger has 14 and Jeter now has five. Will both records eventually go down?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I can't comment on Tiger catching Jack, but Derek has a little ways to go still to catch me.\n\n\n\n __Would you say a catcher is like being a pitcher's caddie?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I would say that. They pay attention to the catcher. I always told them, \"I'm in the game more than you are. I'm back there and I know what's going on.\"\n\n\n\n __If you were Mickelson's caddie, how would you coach him through the last few holes of a major?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oh boy. That's tough. I know he has had some good ones and some bad ones. The only thing you can do is to tell him to trust himself. He might tell me to go to hell. *[Laughs.]*\n\n\n\n __Do you watch a lot of golf on TV?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oh yeah. There are a lot of new guys, boy. They're hitting the hell out of that ball. I wish they had that technology when I could play.\n\n\n\n __If you had a three-foot putt for your life, would you putt it, or would you call someone like Tiger to putt it for you.__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Well, Tiger's not bad. *[Laughs.] *I might call him.\n\n\n\n __If you could win the Masters, U.S. Open or be a part of a winning Ryder Cup team, which would you choose?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Both of 'em. *[Laughs.]*\n\n\n\n __You're famous for saying, \"It's not over until it's over.\" But golf might be the exception. If a guy gets in the clubhouse with a much better score than the other players left on the course and they can't catch them, in fact, it's over before it's over.__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Oh yeah, it's over, that's right. Pretty good.\n\n\n\n __Have you ever seen a putt come up short and go into the hole?__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n No. I've never seen that. *[Laughs.] *That's me. Never up, never in.",

      "body":"Welcome to another edition of The Grind, where we're not picking up our ball against Suzann Pettersen unless we have signed, written consent that it's a gimme from her. Who could have imagined that Tiger Woods would have back surgery and Jason Day would win a playoff event by six and become No. 1 for the first time, and neither would be the weekend's biggest golf story? \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55fe96b1cba5ef123e4de8f1]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's tough to know exactly what was going on in Pettersen's head in the heat of the moment, and it's even tougher to compare a major international team competition to a buddies trip, but we have a guy who is stingy with giving putts, and let's just say it has NOT helped with his popularity among the group. To Pettersen's credit, she apologized the following day, but the damage had already been done. With the U.S. using the incident as a rallying cry and winning the event, the competitive Norwegian wound up being both the villain *and* the goat of the event. Rough. Maybe we should lay off her for awhile. . . \n\n__WE'RE BUYING__\n\n__Jason Day:__ This is getting silly now. The guy isn't just winning almost every week, he's winning almost every week by SIX shots. Day achieved a longtime goal of getting to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking and he matched Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh as the only golfers in the past 20 years to win at least five times in one PGA Tour season. What a beast. If he does it again this week, it will set up the most intriguing Player of the Year vote ever. Jordan Spieth was thought to have a gimme for that award, but as we saw over the weekend, well, you know. . . \n\n__U.S. Women:__ What a comeback! On Saturday night, I would have bet a whole 12-pack of Cherry Zero (that stuff is liquid gold) on the U.S. losing a third straight Solheim Cup. Instead, the American women ended their first-ever losing streak to the Europeans and did it in the most devastating fashion possible by winning 8.5 of a possible 12 points available in the final session. We hope the U.S. men were taking notes for next year.\n\n__Paula Creamer:__ Speaking of comebacks, what an effort by the controversial captain's pick. Creamer won the first and final match of the Solheim Cup to more than justify Juli Inkster picking her for the team. Inkster hoped Creamer might experience the same type of career revival Adam Scott has had since Greg Norman selected him for the 2009 Presidents Cup. We shall see. On the bright side, unlike the Aussie, Creamer doesn't have to worry about switching from an anchored putting stroke.\n\n__Gary Woodland's jumper:__ And we thought this dude had range off the tee! Check out GW's silky smooth three-point shot:\n\n[#instagram: https://instagram.com/p/7rN8lZkLPB/?taken-by=pgatour]\n\n__WE'RE SELLING__\n\n__Everyone involved with \"Gimmegate\":__ Unfortunately, one incident overshadowed the entire Solheim Cup. Pettersen deserves most of the blame, but she's not alone. If teammate Charley Hull really thought that putt was good (and she CLEARLY did when she walked off the green and sent the wrong signal), she should have spoken up -- even if she risked the wrath of her intimidating partner. As should have European captain Carin Koch, who could have righted all of this at the time. And finally, Alison Lee probably shouldn't have been so hasty to scoop her ball up, especially on the 17th hole of an all-square match. \n\n__Tiger's back:__ On Friday, Woods announced he had undergone a second \"successful\"/surprise surgery on his back two days before. Add \"and coming off another back surgery\" to the following sentence: \"Woods will be 40 when he returns to competition in 2016.\" All good runs come to an end at some point. Just look at that juggernaut \"Modern Family,\" which was finally stopped by \"VEEP\" (Woo!) at the Emmys. Sadly, we're finally ready to concede that this could be it for Woods.\n\n__Jim Furyk's wrist:__ Jimbo must have been in a lot of pain to stop playing when he was only one over through six on a course where he previously shot one of six 59s in tour history. It was also his first WD since the Clinton administration, snapping a streak of 477 completed starts since 1995. If he skips this week's season finale, you know the wrist is *really* bad. __UPDATE:__ Furyk's wrist is feeling *really* bad. He withdrew from the Tour Championship on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n__Nicolas Colsaerts__: After reeling off eight straight birdies during a Thursday 63 at the Italian Open, the Belgian took to Twitter to tell everyone the secret to his success was having a song, Liu Bei's \"Atlas World,\" stuck in his head. Simple, right? Only Colsaerts got a little cocky and failed to break 70 the final three days as he fell to T-20. An up-and-coming Ryder Cup star three years ago, he's fallen to 219th in the OWGR. He might be onto something with this music thing, though. My best round ever consisted of six birdies at Tobacco Road, and I couldn't stop humming the intro to The Jackson 5's \"Sugar Daddy\" the entire time. . .\n\n__ON TAP__\n\nThe PGA Tour heads to Atlanta for its season finale, the Tour Championship, aka the only golf tournament of the year in which someone can walk away with $11.5 MILLION.\n\n[Related: 15 signs you watch too much golf on TV](http://www.golfdigest.com/golf-tours-news/2014-02/signs-too-much-golf-tv-photos#slide=1)\n\n__Random tournament fact:__ Bill Haas once won the FedEx Cup despite having NO idea he had won the FedEx Cup.

I'm more torn than Elmore Rudolph Torn, Jr., who goes by the stage name \"Rip.\" I'm more torn than...(*checking Wikipedia for more \"torn\" references*)...a 2013 Nigerian psychological thriller starring Ireti Doyle and Monalisa Chinda. You get me: I'm in torn-ado alley, Day vs. Spieth is a category-5 twister, and all I can hear are ominous wind chimes from the front porch of my trailer home.\n\nI can no longer hide in the basement of my own indecisiveness. This is the hardest question in golf, and the only way to answer is to stage a debate...*with myself.* \n\n\n[#image: /photos/560005d9b96e14727824c2be]||||||\n\nThe opening statement goes to Special Golf Digest Correspondent S.P. Ryan.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nGood evening. I'd like to begin by painting a portrait of my opponent as a dangerous, unstable communist, with medically diagnosed hygiene issues that have cost him dozens of relationships and at least one car.\n\nThat being said, this debate is easy -- 21-year-old Jordan Spieth won the Masters and U.S. Open, and became only the third player in history to finish fourth or better in all four majors. As my esteemed colleague Kyle Porter [pointed out](http://www.cbssports.com/golf/eye-on-golf/25273263/did-jordan-spieth-just-have-the-best-major-season-ever), Spieth, now 22, had the second-best major season in golf history. In the year's biggest tournaments, there was simply no one better than the 21 year old, who later became 22. We will remember 2015 for those victories, and for his unstoppable march to the no. 1 world ranking as a 21-slash-22-year-old.\n\nI hope you'll notice that just like Hillary Clinton in the 2015 primaries, I have not mentioned a single other candidate—either an irascible, wild-haired Senator from Vermont, or an injury-prone Aussie who didn't win his first major until the decrepit age of 27. They just *don't matter*. Did I mention Jordan Spieth was 21 years old, and is now 22?\n\nI cede the floor to my opponent, the so-called \"author\" Shane P.R., with a question: Why won't you admit that Jordan Spieth is young?\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to speak the name Ronald Reagan out loud three times. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Thank you.\n\nSecond, detractors can keep the words \"Jason Day\" out of their mouths as long as they want, but the fact remains that Day is exhibiting the kind of dominance right now that exceeds even Spieth's greatest moments. Day also has a major title, and hold on just a moment as I look up the name of the player he beat...here we go, it was...yes, it was Jordan Spieth!\n\n\nIn addition to the PGA, Day won the Farmers Insurance Open and the RBC Canadian Open, and now he's making an absolute mockery of the FedEx Cup playoffs. He will undoubtedly win this weekend's Tour Championship, trumping Spieth in money, FedEx Cup points, and wins. And I couldn't help but notice that my opponent mentioned the world rankings. Has he stopped by the OWGR lately? Check your facts, sir -- Jason Day [is the best golfer in the world.](http://www.owgr.com)\n\nIn conclusion, Ronald Reagan.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nIs there a reason my opponent isn't wearing an Augusta National pin on his lapel? Does he not love golf? Personally, I'm happy to wear my pin, and to shout my love of this great game to the entire world. And by \"entire world,\" I mean America.\n\nSince we're discussing minor victories, I'd like to point out that Spieth also prevailed at the Valspar and the John Deere Classic this season. He's missed exactly four cuts, and notched 14 top-ten finishes.\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nDay has cracked the top 10 an even 10 times, in fewer tournaments. He's only missed two cuts, and he has more overall wins than Spieth. And I would urge all Americans to ask themselves a very simple question when they sit down at their kitchen tables tonight: Is Jordan Spieth's game better off today than it was two months ago? Is Jason Day's?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nI'd like to tell the story of a seven-year-old child who approached me at the Barclays this year. He cried a single tear, and he told me he was worried for his family. The boy's name was Little Bobby Heartland-Values, and he said, \"Mr. Ryan, what does it mean if a foreigner wins Player of the Year? Does that mean America dies?\" And I'm ashamed to say I couldn't answer him, my friends. But I'd urge you to contemplate Bobby's words. *Does America die?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nThat's just more of the same old anti-immigrant rhetoric spewed by pro-Spieth zealots. America didn't die last year when Rory McIlroy won.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\n*Didn't it?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nYou have to stop doing that.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\n*Do I?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nLook, let's not get distracted. Jason Day is the best golfer in the world, he has more tournament victories than Spieth, he won a major, and he's about to win the PGA Tour's top prize. Period.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nWhen a player wins the Masters and the U.S. Open in the same year -- and joins the likes of Tiger and Hogan to become just the sixth player to do so -- the only way he doesn't win Player of the Year is if somebody else wins the British and PGA. Nobody else did that. Spieth is your man. End of discussion.\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nI made a vow not to go dirty in this campaign, but I think the American people deserve an answer: How do you respond to accusations made by respectable outlets that your player choked at the world's most famous course?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nSCURRILOUS LIBEL! How do you respond to my claim, that I'm making up right now, that your player faked vertigo to generate sympathy?\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nHOW DARE YOU! How do you respond to PGA Tour sources who say with absolute certainty that Spieth is a dumpster diving vegan who keeps a portrait of Martha Burk in his bedroom?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nHOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE GHOST OF RONALD REAGAN, WHO SAID THAT—\n\n----\n\nIt devolved from there—the rest is unprintable, and totally unhelpful. I'm full of self-loathing, and I think our political system is broken.\n\nBob Harig [pointed out](http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/13690949/trying-clear-player-year-question-jordan-spieth-jason-day) that every two-time major winner has also won Player of the Year, but so has every five-time winner. Something's gotta give, and I don't just mean our collective sanity. Will the American voters pick Spieth? Will Day get the benefit of the doubt for owning the PGA Tour all year? Is Tiger done? There's so much left to be decided, and I get the feeling it won't feel decided even after it's decided. Which is why I feel decidedly undecided. Thank you, and may God bless this great sport of golf.\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55e5c1c4b91019d74c997df9]||||||\n\n\n",

      "body":"As the best players on the PGA Tour descend on East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta for the 29th playing of The TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola, many of golf’s past and present legends are also in town to attend the presentation of the prestigious Payne Steward Award. This award was created in 2000 by the PGA TOUR to carry on the legacy of Payne Stewart and the values of character, charity and sportsmanship that he held so dear. The award has been presented annually at The TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola ever since Stewart tragically perished in a plane crash on his way to the same event in 1999, and it’s given to a player recognized by his peers and the industry for his accomplishments on and off the course. Southern Company has presented the award since its inception as it aligns with their core values of trust, performance and commitment, and this year’s recipient is Ernie Els. \n\n[#image: /photos/560009c5b96e14727824c303]||||||\n\n\nEls is the parent of an autistic son, and his name has become synonymous with the fight against autism since the launch of the Els for Autism Foundation in 2009. In addition to using their public platform to bring much-needed attention to the disease, Ernie and Liezl Els’ fundraising efforts culminated last month with the opening of the Els Center of Excellence, a $30 million full-service school for autistic children in the Jupiter, Fla., area, for 300 students between the ages of three and 21. And while The Big Easy’s charitable efforts have been widely celebrated in the media, it’s his skillful play, character and sportsmanship that make him a fan and friend favorite in galleries and locker rooms across the world.   \n\n\n\nEls is the latest in a long line of players who have been recognized for embodying Payne Stewart’s core values. Davis Love III, who’s always been committed to using his profit to benefit others, was honored in 2008 for his work to support national and community-based programs for children and families through the Davis Love Foundation. Byron Nelson, one of the three inaugural honorees in 2000, was often described as a man of character and a true gentleman, just like Stewart. Nelson was introduced to the game as a caddie but later went on to set PGA TOUR records while always remaining humble no matter how high he climbed. Kenny Perry, the 2009 Payne Stewart Award winner, has placed a great deal of value on leaving a lasting image during his career. He and Stewart shared the knowledge that charitable giving impacts many more lives than any pin-hunting 5-irons or clutch putts. And when Ben Crenshaw was honored in 2001, it was just as much for his steadfast sportsmanship and integrity on the golf course as it was for his charitable efforts. Similar to Payne Stewart, Crenshaw always acts as the consummate professional no matter what the outcome may be.\n \n\nThe Payne Stewart Award is accompanied by a $500,000 contribution from Southern Company, with $100,000 going to the First Tee of the Ozarks, $100,000 to the Stewart Family Foundation and $300,000 to the winner and his selected charities, and Els has chosen the Els for Autism Foundation as his selected charity.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[__WATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS__](http://video.golfdigest.com/)\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55e5c1c4b91019d74c997df9]||||||\n\n\n",

      "rubric":"Gamesmanship",
      "body":"The conceded putt is a mystery to me. And I am more certain of this uncertainty after Sunday’s display of gamesmanship/poor sportsmanship by Suzann Pettersen at the Solheim Cup. What Pettersen did seemed on one hand so obviously wrong, so incongruent with golf’s very essence that the outrage might have been less if she flipped the bird at Juli Inkster or made the Gangsta Rap throat-slash gesture at Brittany Lincicome. (Privately, there are some who suggest golf could use some of this, that the game needs less garden party and more Fight Club. But I digress.)\n\nThe fact is the Solheim Cup controversy only exists because the conceded putt is such an inscrutable element of the modern game. Putting aside the most ridiculously obvious concessions (is there such a thing?), the gesture is more emotion than action, the grayest kind of gray in a game that is essentially only black and white. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55fe96a4cba5ef123e4de8ed]||||||\n\n\nOn the one hand, I wonder if it is some vestigial tail reminder of our baser instincts, all vaguely couched in condescension or disgust. The thought bubble that surrounds every concession goes something like this: “Yeah, I’m giving this to you, but we both know that I don’t really think you’re good enough to make it if it really mattered. Moreover, I’m giving it to you because I’m better or holier or somehow more virtuous than you or any of your kind will ever be. And I need to remind you of that very fact at this very instant.”\n\nOr worse, maybe the concession is just a grotesque form of strategy. Give short putts early, but make them putt those same putts when it’s late. It’s as if a cheap three-card monty con game was thrown in the middle of golf, the holiest cathedral of sport. Golf Digest’s instruction editor Peter Morrice reminded me that noted sports psychologist Dr. Richard Coop once suggested that early in a match, give the putt to your opponent when she leaves it short and make her putt it when she rolls it past. Subconsciously, she’ll think if it’s left short, she’ll be granted the next putt. Late in a tight match, she'll never reach the hole. Coop’s tactic seems at once as ingenious and laudable as it is a kind of cartoonish Simon Bar Sinister scurvy trick. How can conceding a putt be wrong and right at the same time?\n\nAnd yet there’s the rub. The concession also seems imbued with a mythic grace, evidence of a certain spiritual nobility of golf’s better self -- and ours, as well. Other sports do not have this kind of ritualized acquiescence, this prescribed displays of honor. There are no conceded field goals in football, no gimme home runs or penalty kicks. Everywhere else in the vast panoply of sport -- from darts to drag racing -- is a fight to the death by any means necessary. By most appearances, golf stands on a higher plane.  And this sense of moral high ground runs true whether you are in your 30s or your 70s. Young Golf Digest veterans Max Adler and not-as-young Bob Carney think of the given putt in similar ways.\n\nAdler: “I've definitely played with golfers who give putts when it feels like the hole deserves to be halved; as in both players reached the green with the same quality of shots and it doesn't seem right that just because one lagged to one foot and the other to 30 inches that anyone should win.”\n\nCarney: \"I have come to think that gentility is a virtue and what the sport is about. Sounds corny, but expecting or hoping to win based on someone else's misplay is less satisfying and also engenders weakness in oneself. Err on the side of the gimme. Gimme when you'd want someone to do the same for you.”\n\n\n[#image: /photos/56000601b96e14727824c2c2]||||||\n\n\nOf course, the most notable example of that kind of gentility writ large in golf’s history is Jack Nicklaus’s gesture at the 1969 Ryder Cup. Nicklaus conceded a putt of relatively inconsequential length to Tony Jacklin to end the 1969 matches in a draw. It was noble and ultimately immaterial in that the tied matches meant the U.S. retained the Cup, but it spoke volumes about Nicklaus’ class. \n\nOr did it? Many still argue whether Nicklaus should have done it, and U.S. captain Sam Snead disagreed with it ‘til the day he died. It makes you wonder whether there ever is a right time to not concede a putt. The Pettersen incident turns the whole idea of conceding a putt on its head, leaving us further confused.\n\nThere are certainly plausible examples of times when not conceding a remaining tiddler seems more right than wrong. I and many on staff here offer just a few, some nefarious, others less so, almost all entirely justifiable. But to get you started:\n\n - When your opponent marks his ball with one of those huge casino chip \n   markers.\n - When your opponent has already broken his/her putter.\n - When it’s to win the match—no matter how short.\n - When your opponent has a bad case of the yips.\n - When your opponent asks \"Good-Good?”\n - When you prefer to play as a onesome for the rest of your life.\n - When you’re legally blind.\n\nBut I’m not sure any of these suggestions make Sunday’s incident or the very practice of conceding putts or in this case not conceding them any more definitive. [According to USGA Museum historians](http://www.usga.org/articles/2015/05/conceding-putts--a-history.html), Michael Trostel and Victoria Student, the idea of a conceded putt dates at least as far back as the 19th century. \n\nBut what is most telling to me is that the idea was accompanied by a very clear edict that held firm until the 1930s, which read: “The Rules of Golf Committee recommends that players should not concede putts to their opponents.” \n\nAnd yet here we are. Whose path is more admirable then, that of Nicklaus or Pettersen? Or neither? One is clearly more despicable than the other, yet both remain rooted in uncertainty. And that doesn’t seem right. Golf is the most certain game I know. About as dead solid certain as a two-footer.\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55a547271bedf5e91fc0a894]||||||",
