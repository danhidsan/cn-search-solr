Not even close. Most of today's young players are bred on the college circuit and come out ready to win, but the Korean-born Lee took a different route.\n\n\nAt age 11, Danny moved with his family to New Zealand when his father became ill. They stayed for six years while he received cancer treatments. So Danny learned golf as a Kiwi of sorts, which explains his unique way of talking. \"He's caught between Korean and English with a New Zealand accent,\" says his teacher of 18 months, Drew Steckel. \n\nLee's father recovered, and the family immigrated to the United States. Danny was working with Jim Flick and won the 2010 U.S. Amateur at age 18, then the youngest-ever winner. But after Flick died in 2012, Lee lost his way, bouncing around tours and among teachers. \"I saw a lot of instructors,\" Lee says, \"but nothing felt right. Then I found Drew.\" \n\n\"I'm like a big brother,\" Steckel says. \"I make sure he focuses on golf.\" That doesn't seem very hard to do. Steckel says: \"He practices more than anyone out here.\" In July, Lee got his first PGA Tour win, at the Greenbrier Classic. Stay tuned. ",

      "body":"One of the critical moments in any golf swing is the transition from backswing to downswing. A lot of instruction in this phase of the swing is geared toward what the lower body is doing, which is important but doesn't always fix a slice. To straighten out a slice, focus on getting your left arm moving in the proper direction as you start down. \n\nBy doing this, your club will strike the ball with the path and face angle that produces solid contact and eliminates the slice. Here are a couple of things you can work on to improve your transition, with LPGA Tour rookie Therese Koelbaek demonstrating.  \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f82db64759c60c082433a4]||||||\n\n\n\n__THE MOVE__\n\nWhen a slicer starts the downswing, the left arm moves excessively outward and away from the torso. This mistake sends the club into the ball in an open position relative to the swing path. Avoid this problem by minimizing the outward movement of the left arm as you change direction. To learn this motion, grab a club and practice swinging to the top at slow speed and starting down with your left arm still angled inside the target line (*above*). A good feel is that your left arm is maintaining a strong connection to your torso as you change direction.\n\n__THE DRILL__\n\nTo understand what it feels like to get your left arm into an anti-slice position, check out the drill Therese is demonstrating here. Start with your left arm relatively straight, and hold the wrist with your right hand (*below*). Make your backswing motion and mimic the first part of the downswing, sensing your left arm applying pressure to your torso at the change of direction. Groove this feeling of your left arm staying to the inside, and say goodbye to the dreaded slice.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f82e0bb91019d74c99b8c5]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n*Bernie Najar, who is based at Caves Valley Golf Club near Baltimore, is Golf Digest's \nNo. 1-ranked teacher in Maryland.*",

      "body":"The fifth hole at Quivira Golf Club in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, is the kind of drivable par 4 I'd never seek to build. But when I saw this knob of cliff just big enough for a green, I couldn't pass. Mostly, I'm not a fan of severe downhill tee shots. It's displeasing to stand on your toes and wonder when your ball is going to stop. \n\nThe goal was to find a way to play golf here that wasn't gimmicky. \n\nIf you're in a stroke-play event on a hole like this, lay up off the tee. But if your objective is fun, maybe go for the green. \n\nI could've built a more traditional hole away from the cliffs, but with this setting, I couldn't bear to be so sensible. That's what makes it a big tease. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f9b10eb91019d74c99c0f7]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n__GO FOR GLORY...__\n\nFrom the back tees, the vertical drop to the green is 115 feet. As a rule, every 10 feet of gradient equals about three yards, so the 262-yard carry to the front of this green is more like 230 (210 from the middle tees). If you aren't that long but want to go for it, favor the right side. Hit a draw, and the slope will kick your ball toward the green. There are three native areas on the right, but getting hung up in one isn't horrible. Go at the green, and short, long or left is bye-bye.  \n\n\n__...OR PLAY SMART__\n\nIf you've selected a hybrid or long iron off the tee, it doesn't mean you can take a mental vacation. Play this lay-up with precision, and you'll have a better chance to hit your second shot close. Considering wind and turf speed, you need 195 to 210 yards. Short of that, and your view of the flag will be obscured by a rise in the fairway. Long, and your ball could scamper into an awkward lie. Unlike the glory shot, here the miss is left--in the bunker beats the scrub on the right.\n\n__And If It's Real Windy...__\n\nThe wind will howl off the Pacific Ocean. From pitching-wedge distance on the approach, I see golfers chose an 8- or 9-iron. That's not nearly enough. I might take a 5-iron, grip down to the steel of the shaft, and basically chip it. That limits the spin, so the ball won't climb and sail out of control. \n\n*With Max Adler*\n\n----------\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55a546eb1bedf5e91fc0a6c6]||||||\n\n\n",

      "body":"With all due respect to the late Sam Snead and his well-intended advice, if you grip your club like you're holding a baby bird and try to maintain that light pressure, you won't like the result. Ever see tour players hit shots in slow motion? Do they look like they're out for a Sunday stroll? No, they're taking a serious rip at the ball, and the strained expressions on their faces prove it.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes I see is golfers trying to make loosey-goosey, tension-free swings. Things easily get out of sync that way, plus there's no real power behind the shot. The arms and body should be working together, especially through the impact zone. One of the best ways to improve that partnership is to hit iron shots out of thick grass. It might sound like a strange practice drill, but believe me, you don't see people trying to get out of the rough with floppy swings. They might start relaxed, but the pressure between the arms and body builds as the swing progresses. They instinctively brace for impact to stabilize the club as it moves through the heavy grass.\n\nThat stable feeling is what you want on your shots from the fairway, too. So go find a spot in some rough where you can practice. I'll give you a couple of keys to help your technique.\n*With Ron Kaspriske*\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f83a43b91019d74c99b9a6]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n__SETUP: GET CONNECTED__\n\nYou'll hit better shots out of the rough if you pre-set the connection between your arms and body. At address, feel pressure in both armpits, the biceps pressed against the chest. As a drill, tuck the sleeves of your shirt under your arms and practice making half swings, keeping that pinch (*above*). Strive for that feeling in your normal swing. If the arms get separated from the torso, you'll struggle to hit the ball out of the heavy grass.\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f83a38b91019d74c99b9a2]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n__GOING BACK: MAKE SURE THE CLUB STAYS WITH YOU__\n\nYou can see as I swing back, my chest and arms are moving in unison, which keeps the club in front of my torso. Think of this as your first move off the ball. You'll know everything is moving together if the bottom edge of the clubface is roughly parallel to your spine angle at this point in the backswing (*above*). This is also where I want to be when I swing down: the club in front of my upper body. Get it right, and you'll start puring your iron shots.\n\n\n*Josh Zander, a Golf Digest Teaching Professional, is based at the Stanford (Calif.) University Golf Course and the Presidio Golf Course in San Francisco.*\n\n----------\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55a546f31bedf5e91fc0a710]||||||\n\n\n",

This helps provide good wrist action and aids in delivering the clubface squarely to the ball, no matter how you swing the club. Make the switch, and it won't take long to feel natural.

      "body":"How do you aim a long breaking putt? Well, you have a few options. Dave Stockton and Arnold Palmer have advised me over the years to pick a spot right in front of the ball on the path to the putt's apex, or highest point of the break. Another strategy is to aim farther down the line, about halfway, at the actual apex.\n\nMy preferred method is a little different. First, I figure out how much the putt will break. Then, I pick a spot that's an extension of that path to the apex, all the way out to hole-high (*above*). This allows me to treat a big breaker like it's a straight putt. I simply aim at that spot even with the hole.\n\nAverage golfers tend to underplay break, because their focus is typically on the hole and not on getting the ball on the correct path. These options move the emphasis away from the cup and help you start the ball on a line that gives it a chance to drop.\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55f05412b91019d74c99a0fc]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n                           \n\n__ELEMENTARY WATSON__\nOne of the benefits to walking when you play is seeing the contours of a green as you approach it. That's where you should start your read. Then confirm what you see by walking outside your putting line to the cup, feeling the slope with your feet.\n\n*Excerpted from the DVD \"Lessons of a Lifetime II,\" by Tom Watson.*",

But who can forget his ups and downs over the final nine at Atlanta Athletic Club that week--eagle, triple bogey, birdie, birdie--to force a playoff with close friend Jason Dufner. It was Dufner who got Bradley together with veteran teacher Chuck Cook in late 2013. (Dufner also works with Cook.)\n\n\"We haven't done much on Keegan's full swing,\" Cook says. \"He hits the ball great off the tee and on long approaches. But I want him to be more aggressive with the shorter clubs.\" Cook says that not anchoring his putter (anchoring will be against the rules starting in 2016) has been a testy transition for Bradley. \"He's conventional now, but we had to move his eyes more over the line, and that takes some getting used to. He's had great putting rounds, but he's not consistent yet.\"\n\nBradley is also known for his unusual pre-shot routine: He stutter-steps from behind the ball, then regroups and repeats until he's comfortable. \"He's visualizing the shot,\" Cook says. \"He doesn't want to hit until he's ready. That's a good thing.\"",

      "body":"At the 2014 Humana Challenge, I had a streak with my short irons--8-iron through pitching wedge--where I felt I couldn't miss. I opened 63-63-63, firing at every flag, then held on for the win. I've been chasing that feeling ever since. With all respect to the other clubs, playing aggressively with the short irons is what leads to low numbers. Your goal should be to narrow your \"lines,\" or the parameters of your misses, so you have no fear. To do that, you need good fundamentals and a few repeating swing keys. Here are mine. *--With Guy Yocom*\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55e9a2e2b91019d74c998ef3]|||\nEasy Squeeze: To keep the club in front of you, feel a slight pressure in the last three fingers of your left hand.\n|||\n\n\n\n\nBack: Feel Like Your Hands Are 'inside Your Chest'\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBecause the short irons are precision clubs, you need precise fundamentals. Align your feet carefully with the target line, and your hips and shoulders will fall into place automatically. I like my weight distributed 60-40 on my left side, and I keep it that way throughout the backswing. I position the ball in the center of my stance, but if center doesn't feel right to you, play it back a bit--that's better for solid contact than playing it up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the swing with your arms and shoulders moving back together, so one part doesn't outrace the other. Focus on keeping your hands in front of your torso: I like them to feel \"inside my chest\" (1). At the top, my swing has a distinct pause (2), which helps me create a smooth sequence coming down. Start the downswing all at once (3), so your arms don't lag behind and cause the club to fall behind you. \n\n[#image: /photos/55e9a2e34759c60c08240a28]||||||\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55e9a2e2b91019d74c998eee]|||\nHole Truth: Monitor your divots. With a short iron, they should be the length and width of a dollar bill.\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nDown: Keep Your Feet Planted Through Impact\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe outer limit of my 9-iron is 160 yards, plenty long to get at the tucked flags on tour. But power won't do you much good if you lose control. An important key is quiet feet that stay like they were at address: glued to the ground (4). There's no rolling of the feet, no dramatic weight shift. Your knees should be soft and flexed and stay level through impact. \n\nYou also have to control clubface rotation. If you keep your arms in front of your body during the downswing, the face will square up, then close after impact (5). Don't flip the face closed with your hands, as that will deloft the club and kill trajectory. The horizontal position of my club at the finish (6) proves I haven't flipped at the ball. If I had, the shaft would be down my back. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55e9a2e2b91019d74c998eeb]||||||\n\n\n\n\n*Patrick Reed, ranked 15th in the world, has won four times on the PGA Tour.*\n\n\n----------\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55a547201bedf5e91fc0a86e]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That, combined with a slight tilting of your upper body away from the target, will promote a high launch.\n\n• Stay loose by keeping your arms and legs in motion as you stand over the ball. Good drives come when you maximize your freedom of motion.",

          "caption":"A good start to the swing is essential. Get it wrong, and everything can go south (apart from the numbers on the scorecard):\n\n• Start your hands, arms and shoulders back together for maximum efficiency; don't let your hands take over the swing.\n\n• When the club reaches parallel to the ground, the clubhead should be in line with or just outside your hands. This means the swing is on plane, setting up solid contact and good direction.\n\n• Turn your shoulders on the downward angle they were at setup rather than level to the ground. The latter would make your swing too flat and inside.",

          "title":"BACKSWING",
          "caption":"The better the backswing, the simpler the move back to the ball. Here's how to get there:\n\n• Stay in your address angles. If you lift out of your posture, you have to drop down the same amount before impact, or else risk making poor contact.\n\n• Keeping the right leg flexed as weight is shifting onto it ensures that the body is coiling and storing energy.\n\n• If your club reaches parallel to the ground at the top, it should point about at your target. That means your swing has stayed on plane, and you won't have to make any downswing compensations.",

          "caption":"The return to the ball takes only milliseconds, so make it count:\n\n• A good indicator of power is when the lower-body turn is leading the upper-body turn. If they unwind together, you leave yards on the table.\n\n• Keep your right elbow close to your body as the club moves down to make sure the club stays on an inside path to the ball.\n\n• When you maintain the angle between your left arm and the shaft as you swing down, you have what's called \"clubhead lag.\" The more you lag it, the more acceleration you'll have at the bottom of the swing.",

          "caption":"The moment of truth! Here's what to focus on:\n\n• Good compression of the ball comes from a good weight transfer. Feel as if you've shifted all of your weight from your back foot to your front by impact.\n\n• The clubface should be rotating closed as your right arm extends and starts to roll over the left.\n\n• Swinging the club out to the ball from the inside will promote an easy, repeatable draw.",

          "caption":"Want to look good for the cameras? Try these tips:\n\n• After impact, your arms should be fully extended toward the target. That's a sign that you've expended all of the energy you created in the backswing.\n\n• Your weight should be firmly planted onto a stable front leg.\n\n• Body rotation shouldn't stop at impact. Your torso should continue turning left even as the ball flies down the fairway.",

          "caption":"No need for anything fancy here. Keep the motion compact and simple:\n\n• Set up with more of your weight on your front side, with the ball off your back foot. That'll help you hit down or solid contact.\n\n• Keep your wrists firm and your hands ahead of the clubhead. Less hand action will make it harder to thin or chunk the shot.\n\n• A good way to avoid decelerating is to keep your upper body turning through the shot. Your chest should face the target at the finish.",

          "caption":"Bunkers are intimidating, until you learn how easy this shot can be:\n\n• The sand is unstable, so build a solid foundation. Take a wide stance, and really dig in your feet.\n\n• You're not actually hitting the ball on bunker shots--you're hitting the sand just behind the ball--so you need to make a big swing back and through.\n\nTo hit high, soft bunker shots, the clubface has to slide under the ball. To make this happen and avoid digging too deep, sling the clubhead past your hands through impact.",

          "caption":"Putting with feel won't happen unless you feel good. Here's how:\n\n• Set up with your eyes over the ball and your hands hanging directly under your shoulders. This relieves tension and promotes a repeatable stroke.\n\n• The putterhead should move pretty much straight-back and straight-through, beginning to move on a slight circular arc only as the stroke gets longer.\n\n• To avoid any decelerating or over-accelerating during the stroke, focus on swinging the putter at a steady pace and about the same amount on each side of the ball.",
