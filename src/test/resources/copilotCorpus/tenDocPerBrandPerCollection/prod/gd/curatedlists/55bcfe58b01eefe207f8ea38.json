      "body":"What should the spirit of a golf team match be?\n\nIt's not an easy question, and the key word is golf. In other team sports, \"no mercy\" is a desired mindset. But especially in its team matches, golf has traditionally valued and even demanded gentility and empathy for the opponent.\n \nAt the same time, the competitive game at the elite level is often a lonely ordeal of fear and nerves. In friendly games, we often spare our opponents the indignities of being exposed to that unforgiving standard -- with the odd mulligan or gimmes from three feet. \"Let's just have fun,\" we rationalize. \"Nobody gets hurt.\"\n \nBut getting hurt -- and coming back -- is a big part of the championship test, and a bigger part of why we watch.\n \nSo when it comes to team matches like the Ryder Cup, the just-completed Solheim Cup and the upcoming Presidents Cup, should there be a middle ground? How much should we expect \"sportsmanship\" to factor into the modern iteration of these matches, when the participants know that losing will subject them to cruel judgment by a world audience filled with fervent partisans.\n \nIt's not an easy answer. Romantics cite Jack Nicklaus giving Tony Jacklin a shortie on the final hole of the 1969 Ryder Cup. The concession left U.S. captain Sam Snead -- who once missed a 30-incher to lose the U.S. Open -- livid, but it remains the most enduring act in Ryder Cup history.\n \nSo was Suzann Pettersen a villain, or a tightly wound competitor so swept up in the most emotional event in the women's game that she lapsed into \"just win, baby\" territory? Or even. . . just a golfer? In match play, waiting for a crucial chance to suddenly and shockingly force an opponent to putt from a distance that had previously been conceded is a nuance of the game's psychological warfare. Pettersen might have felt she had young Allison Lee set up for just such a moment on the 17th hole of their tense fourball match.\n \nLee mistakenly scooped up her 20-incher like a routine concession, but if she'd had to putt it to keep from going 1 down, she would have felt nerves. The putt was the same length as the missed 72nd hole \"tap-in\" that tragically kept I.K. Kim from winning the 2012 Kraft Nabisco Championship.\n \nPettersen had every right to object to Lee picking the ball up when no words by either European player were said. But with the option of having Lee replace her ball and stroke the putt -- or simply to change her mind and concede the putt -- Pettersen -- by insisting the Americans lost the hole -- made the wrong choice.\n \nShe violated the unspoken code of team play. Because failure in such matches goes beyond the individual and can cause devastating scars from letting down teammates, captains and country, players have more compassion for the plight of their opponents. Everybody gets hurt in competitive golf, but in team golf, no one wants the hurt to be the worst kind. (Pettersen issued an apology for her actions the following day.)\n\nOn the same day as the Pettersen/Lee incident, a similar situation occurred at the PGA Cup -- which matches club pros from the U.S. against a squad from Great Britain and Ireland -- played at CordeValle in San Martin, CA. Stuart Deane of the U.S. won the 11th hole of his match against David Dixon of GB&I because Dixon picked up a six-inch putt that Deane had not conceded. But in this case, when Allen Wronowski, the PGA's Honorary President and captain of the U.S. team, learned what had happened, he found Deane -- who was 3 down -- on the 13th hole and ordered him to concede the 14th hole, which Deane did. Dixon went on to win the match 4 and 3, and GB&I triumphed 13 1/2 to 12 1/2.\n \nWronowski followed the Nicklaus model of team golf -- play hard but with heart -- and leave the arena deeply respected by your peers and followers. When the fiery Pettersen -- a likely Hall of Famer -- looks back, that lost chance is what she'll regret the most.",

Sure, smaller collars are a bit trendier and can look more modern, but go too small and you'll look like your shopping in the boys department.\n\n[Adidas Golf](http://adidasgolf.com/)",

      "body":"I thought this would be easy, but I'm torn. Very, very torn.  I'm more torn than Natalie Imbruglia in 1997. I'm more torn than Elmore Rudolph Torn, Jr., who goes by the stage name \"Rip.\" I'm more torn than...(*checking Wikipedia for more \"torn\" references*)...a 2013 Nigerian psychological thriller starring Ireti Doyle and Monalisa Chinda. You get me: I'm in torn-ado alley, Day vs. Spieth is a category-5 twister, and all I can hear are ominous wind chimes from the front porch of my trailer home.\n\nI can no longer hide in the basement of my own indecisiveness. This is the hardest question in golf, and the only way to answer is to stage a debate...*with myself.* \n\n\n[#image: /photos/560005d9b96e14727824c2be]||||||\n\nThe opening statement goes to Special Golf Digest Correspondent S.P. Ryan.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nGood evening. I'd like to begin by painting a portrait of my opponent as a dangerous, unstable communist, with medically diagnosed hygiene issues that have cost him dozens of relationships and at least one car.\n\nThat being said, this debate is easy -- 21-year-old Jordan Spieth won the Masters and U.S. Open, and became only the third player in history to finish fourth or better in all four majors. As my esteemed colleague Kyle Porter [pointed out](http://www.cbssports.com/golf/eye-on-golf/25273263/did-jordan-spieth-just-have-the-best-major-season-ever), Spieth, now 22, had the second-best major season in golf history. In the year's biggest tournaments, there was simply no one better than the 21 year old, who later became 22. We will remember 2015 for those victories, and for his unstoppable march to the no. 1 world ranking as a 21-slash-22-year-old.\n\nI hope you'll notice that just like Hillary Clinton in the 2015 primaries, I have not mentioned a single other candidate—either an irascible, wild-haired Senator from Vermont, or an injury-prone Aussie who didn't win his first major until the decrepit age of 27. They just *don't matter*. Did I mention Jordan Spieth was 21 years old, and is now 22?\n\nI cede the floor to my opponent, the so-called \"author\" Shane P.R., with a question: Why won't you admit that Jordan Spieth is young?\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to speak the name Ronald Reagan out loud three times. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan. Thank you.\n\nSecond, detractors can keep the words \"Jason Day\" out of their mouths as long as they want, but the fact remains that Day is exhibiting the kind of dominance right now that exceeds even Spieth's greatest moments. Day also has a major title, and hold on just a moment as I look up the name of the player he beat...here we go, it was...yes, it was Jordan Spieth!\n\n\nIn addition to the PGA, Day won the Farmers Insurance Open and the RBC Canadian Open, and now he's making an absolute mockery of the FedEx Cup playoffs. He will undoubtedly win this weekend's Tour Championship, trumping Spieth in money, FedEx Cup points, and wins. And I couldn't help but notice that my opponent mentioned the world rankings. Has he stopped by the OWGR lately? Check your facts, sir -- Jason Day [is the best golfer in the world.](http://www.owgr.com)\n\nIn conclusion, Ronald Reagan.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nIs there a reason my opponent isn't wearing an Augusta National pin on his lapel? Does he not love golf? Personally, I'm happy to wear my pin, and to shout my love of this great game to the entire world. And by \"entire world,\" I mean America.\n\nSince we're discussing minor victories, I'd like to point out that Spieth also prevailed at the Valspar and the John Deere Classic this season. He's missed exactly four cuts, and notched 14 top-ten finishes.\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nDay has cracked the top 10 an even 10 times, in fewer tournaments. He's only missed two cuts, and he has more overall wins than Spieth. And I would urge all Americans to ask themselves a very simple question when they sit down at their kitchen tables tonight: Is Jordan Spieth's game better off today than it was two months ago? Is Jason Day's?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nI'd like to tell the story of a seven-year-old child who approached me at the Barclays this year. He cried a single tear, and he told me he was worried for his family. The boy's name was Little Bobby Heartland-Values, and he said, \"Mr. Ryan, what does it mean if a foreigner wins Player of the Year? Does that mean America dies?\" And I'm ashamed to say I couldn't answer him, my friends. But I'd urge you to contemplate Bobby's words. *Does America die?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nThat's just more of the same old anti-immigrant rhetoric spewed by pro-Spieth zealots. America didn't die last year when Rory McIlroy won.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\n*Didn't it?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nYou have to stop doing that.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\n*Do I?*\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nLook, let's not get distracted. Jason Day is the best golfer in the world, he has more tournament victories than Spieth, he won a major, and he's about to win the PGA Tour's top prize. Period.\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nWhen a player wins the Masters and the U.S. Open in the same year -- and joins the likes of Tiger and Hogan to become just the sixth player to do so -- the only way he doesn't win Player of the Year is if somebody else wins the British and PGA. Nobody else did that. Spieth is your man. End of discussion.\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nI made a vow not to go dirty in this campaign, but I think the American people deserve an answer: How do you respond to accusations made by respectable outlets that your player choked at the world's most famous course?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nSCURRILOUS LIBEL! How do you respond to my claim, that I'm making up right now, that your player faked vertigo to generate sympathy?\n\n__Shane P.R.__\n\nHOW DARE YOU! How do you respond to PGA Tour sources who say with absolute certainty that Spieth is a dumpster diving vegan who keeps a portrait of Martha Burk in his bedroom?\n\n__S.P. Ryan__\n\nHOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE GHOST OF RONALD REAGAN, WHO SAID THAT—\n\n----\n\nIt devolved from there—the rest is unprintable, and totally unhelpful. I'm full of self-loathing, and I think our political system is broken.\n\nBob Harig [pointed out](http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/13690949/trying-clear-player-year-question-jordan-spieth-jason-day) that every two-time major winner has also won Player of the Year, but so has every five-time winner. Something's gotta give, and I don't just mean our collective sanity. Will the American voters pick Spieth? Will Day get the benefit of the doubt for owning the PGA Tour all year? Is Tiger done? There's so much left to be decided, and I get the feeling it won't feel decided even after it's decided. Which is why I feel decidedly undecided. Thank you, and may God bless this great sport of golf.\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55e5c1c4b91019d74c997df9]||||||\n\n\n",

      "body":"The United States staged a remarkable comeback on Sunday, overcoming the largest deficit in Solheim Cup history -- as well as a controversial call -- to win the 2015 event. \n\nTeam USA started singles play down four points to the European squad, which had won the previous two matchups in 2013 and 2011. And through the first seven matches -- the clubs halved 3 1/2 points in these competitions -- it appeared the Americans would suffer their third straight defeat. \n\nHowever, thanks to a sweep of the final five matches -- with wins by Lizette Salas, Angela Stanford, Cristie Kerr, Michelle Wie and Paula Creamer -- the United States prevailed.\n\nAlas, this Solheim Cup will likely be remembered and discussed for another matter that transpired Sunday at Golf Club St. Leon-Rot in Germany. \n\nIn a hotly-contested fourball match, Alison Lee of the United States had a birdie putt on the 17th hole to give the US a one-hole lead. The putt missed, with Lee's ball coming to rest inches past the hole. The group began walking to the 18th, with the umpire announcing the match was tied. \n\nYet, Suzann Pettersen of Team Europe claimed she had not conceded Lee's putt, and because Lee had picked the ball up, the hole was forfeited. The Europeans ended up winning the match. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55fe96b1cba5ef123e4de8f1]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards, emotions flared. Pettersen's teammate, Charley Hull, disagreed with Pettersen's actions, breaking into tears over the issue. Lee additionally cried, presumably knowing her actions cost her team points. \n\n“It’s just BS,” US captain Juli Inkster said on TV following the match's conclusion. “It puts a damper on the whole thing. No way they can ever justify that. It’s just not right. I don't care what they say. You just don’t do that to your peers.\n\n\"I have never seen anything like it in my career. It's disrespectful.\"\n\nEven the European side acknowledged Pettersen's mistake.\n\n“I’m disgusted,” Laura Davies, a veteran of 12 Solheim Cups for the European team, told Sky Sports. \"We have got our best player, Charley Hull, who has just won a point and she is in floods of tears. That tells you the wrong thing was done.\n\"How Suzann can justify that I will never, ever know. We are all fierce competitors but ultimately it's unfair. We have to play week in, week out together and you do not do something like that to a fellow pro. Poor old Alison Lee must think 'I hope I never play a Solheim Cup again'. She has had food poisoning and now she has been wronged by one of the most senior players in golf and who used to be one of the most respected players.\n\n\"I know [Pettersen] is angry and justifying everything, but she has let herself down and she has certainly let her team down. \"\n\nIt is the ninth win in the Solheim Cup's 14-event history for the United States. The 2017 match will be held at Des Moines Golf and Country Club in Iowa. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[__WATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS__](http://video.golfdigest.com/)\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55e8524eb91019d74c998988]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n",
