      "body":"The pinnacle of my New York Fashion Week came at its very end on Thursday night, when __Marc Jacobs__ spotted __Lana Wachowski__ amidst a slew of well-wishers following his [show’s finale at the Ziegfeld Theatre](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2015/09/marc-jacobs-ziegfeld-theatre-spring-2016-presentation-nyfw). \n\nLana (née Larry) Wachowski, one half of Hollywood’s Wachowski siblings and responsible for films like *The Matrix* and *V for Vendetta*, had not yet met the designer, but the two had traded letters. In one of her first public appearances as a woman, Lana picked a Marc Jacobs dress, and had gushed how happy wearing it made her. After Marc watched [Lana’s speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crHHycz7T_c)  for when she received the Human Rights Campaign’s Visibility Award, the designer wrote her a letter to say he was so moved that he watched it nine times in a row. \n\n“No! No! No!” Marc screamed when her fluorescent dreadlocks were visible over a sea of reporters who were asking Marc what his references were for the collection he just presented. The two hugged and the flashbulbs popped and there was a palpable emotion and sense of depth but also frivolity. It was a fashion show, after all. \n\nThe Lana-Marc meet was the pinnacle of my Fashion Week, a nine-day span that runs the gamut of those kind of emotions. There are tears and tantrums and, [at Michael Kors, medics](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2015/09/a-fashion-emergency-at-nyfw). As I edited my pictures from the week the next day—which I never do until the shows are over because I always shoot them on a real camera (iPhones be damned) and need the time to download and reflect—I relived the dramas and spectacles. Another highlight? __Riccardo Tisci’s__ Givenchy show—the first time the brand has shown in New York City—which was set on the Hudson River, started an hour and a half late, and drew the likes of Kimye and even __Julia Roberts,__ who showed up wearing a T-shirt with the designer’s face on it. \n\nA dinner that __Carine Roitfeld__ hosted at her son __Vladimir’s__ house was a smaller-scale spectacle. __Kim Kardashian__ was there, and introduced me to an invention that I didn’t know existed: the personal selfie lighting apparatus, which is a light that is attached to the case of an iPhone and illuminates the face to the warm, earthy tone we’ve come to expect from Mrs. West. \n\nWhat else? I was happy for my friends __Jack McCollough__ and __Lazaro Hernandez,__ who had a stand-out and fabulous Proenza Schouler show. I had a surreal meta-moment at __Diane von Furstenberg’s__ show when I was sitting across from The Weeknd’s __Abel Tesfaye__ as his inescapable song “I Can’t Feel My Face” hit the soundtrack while his girlfriend, __Bella Hadid__, was on the runway. And, oh, I was happy for myself, too, because my new book *Harper’s Bazaar: Models* was toasted with a signing at the Gagosian bookshop on Madison Avenue. My mommy even came up from Missouri for it.\n\nAnd like any good fashion show, it’s all about a grand finale. Who better than __Madonna__ to take us home? I went to see [the pop icon at Madison Square Garden Thursday night](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/amy-schumer-madonna) and was amazed by the 57-year-old’s onstage agility—and the pushiness of her fans. The crush at the front of the stage was worse than trying to get into Marc’s show earlier in the evening. Lest I forget what the point of the week was, later that night at her after-party, Madonna showed up wearing big buckled, sky-high Alexander McQueen combat boots. This week was all about fashion, baby.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55fc87d33a02e0b16051d1e4]||||||\n\n\n",

      "body":"When the attendees were a few bottles of prosecco deep into my baby shower, the group conversation turned to my future baby’s “style.” Ridiculous, I know, but I ran with it.\n\n“Not quite __[Prince George](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2014/08/prince-george-photos)__-ian,” I contemplated aloud—too formal for a commoner. I likewise vetoed “ironic hipster”—using your baby’s organic onesies to crack bad jokes (“I Had Boobs for Breakfast”) just feels wrong. I settled on “Parisian chic”—Breton stripes, copious bows, and ballet slippers whenever possible.\n\nNot once did I think that a mere 18 months later I would be pleading with my daughter, Hayden, to please take off a [black faux-fur capelet](http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=64920006&cp=2255957.2273447.32649916.33589946&parentPage=family) by Kardashian Kids—__Kim, Khloé, and Kourtney Kardashian’s__ leopard- and pleather-filled clothing line for babies and tots—at eight A.M. before day care. There was nothing Parisian chic about it.\n\nNot only was said cape inappropriate because it was 90 degrees outside, but the official dress code in her classroom is “play clothes (that you don’t mind getting mac n’ cheese encrusted upon”). Hayden reacted with a tantrum not unlike __North West’s__ at [New York Fashion Week](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/fashion-week) during the __Kanye West__ for Adidas show. Except, thankfully, we were alone in my bedroom, not sitting front row next to __Anna Wintour__ and the Carters.\n\nHer stomps and sobs couldn’t have anything to do with my parenting skills, I reasoned, the fact that I sometimes laugh while trying to tell her to stop shampooing her hair with yogurt during dinner. What if dressing your baby in Kardashian Kids clothes just unlocked her inner E! reality-star diva? (After all, it was precisely this sort of meltdown that has made __Kris Jenner__ a very wealthy woman.)\n\n__[Related: My Komfortingly Vanilla Evening *In the Kitchen with Kris* Jenner](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/11/kris-jenner-cookbook-dinner-party)__\n\nThus began three days of dressing my now-19-month-old toddler as the Kardashians intended—or, at least, as the Kardashians deign to make accessible to the masses. Dressing your child like the Kardashians in earnest would mean layering custom Balmain blazers over leotards and tutus for ballet class. Decking Hayden in Kardashian Kids, however, is more like “North West ventures to the suburban strip mall.” The collection is sold at Babies R Us stores and online nationwide, with price points from $7.99 (for a tiara-printed turban headband reminiscent of __Jade Jagger__ in the 70s) to $39.99 (for the capelet, the showpiece of the fall line, according to Hayden).\n\nThe price is right, but Kardashian Kids still captures the luxe, highly sophisticated Kardashian way of dressing children: there are a pair of “wet look” faux-leather leggings. On the Kardashian Kids [Instagram](https://instagram.com/p/66Uy77Q1LX/), toddlers cruise around in mini Range Rover Power Wheels. Could a real kid possibly wear the line and conduct normal, everyday kid business? And remain “grounded” in the process? In the interest of anthropological research, and with the help of an unwitting, highly dramatic child model, I set out to investigate.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f0149a200c3435359189fb]|||\nHayden isn’t quite sure she wants to pair the faux fur capelet with these leather leggings right now. \n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n__Day 1: Playtime in Faux Fur__\n\nHayden removed the capelet that morning only with my assurances that she could put it back on as soon as she got home from school. She had fallen in love with it at first sight. “Neigh, neigh!” she shouted—seeing only a big mass of black fur across the room, she’d assumed it was a stuffed horse. But when I draped the cape across her teeny shoulders, she pursed her lips, clasped her hands together in front of her, and strutted across the living room like a baby goth queen. Or, more aptly, a baby Kardashian.\n\n“She looks like a vampire,” my husband laughed from the couch.\n\nInstead of her usual bunny-printed Gap Kids pajamas, we dressed for after-school playtime in the cape, a Kardashian Kids flowy, [ivory tank top ($19.99)](http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=64919886&cp=2273443.2255985&parentPage=search), and [“wet look” leggings ($22.98)](http://www.toysrus.com/buy/matching-outfits/kardashian-kids-girls-2-piece-light-pink-tiara-printed-draped-top-and-black-wet-look-leggings-toddler-31667-64919986). It’s an outfit that I, as a 33-year-old woman, have more or less worn before, whether to “the club” or to work when I was an editor at *Cosmopolitan*, where leather leggings were practically a job requirement. Hayden looked almost creepily “adult,” but she didn’t seem to notice, leaving the cape on to push her miniature baby-doll stroller across the room.\n\nThough her psyche appeared undamaged, the cape proved impossible to play in. She fussed at the idea of sliding her hands through the openings and properly wearing it, so it slid off her shoulders at the first grab of her blocks. The leather leggings didn’t cling as snugly as they should (a common complaint from some of my former co-workers, incidentally) but they were pliable and comfortable enough to sit on the floor and re-arrange Mr. Potato Head’s face, which is more than I can say for my own pair.\n\nIn a final act of defiance, we went downstairs to check the mail in the lobby of our apartment building.\n\n“*Oh my god*,” gasped our doorman, Angel, who has an eye for fashion. “Is that real?” he asked, eyeing the cape.\n\n“*Oh my god*,” I replied in horror. “No!”\n\nUpside to wearing Kardashian Kids during playtime: takes dress-up to new heights. Downside: people thinking you’re an asshole.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f0149c200c3435359189ff]|||\nHead-to-toe animal print is the perfect outfit for strolling to the bakery on Saturday morning. \n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n__Day 2: A Neighborhood Walk in Head-to-Toe Animal Print__\n\nAround 8:30 A.M. on Saturday, when most single people are still deep in REM sleep, I strap Hayden into her stroller and we head out to get iced coffee and croissants. Instead of wearing her usual striped romper and sparkly sandals, I cringe and festoon her entirely in animal print: the Kardashian Kids [leopard shift ($28.99)](http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=64919856&cp=2255957.2273447.32649916.33589946&parentPage=family) and matching [jogger pants ($28.99)](http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=64919976&cp=2273443.2255985&parentPage=search)—paired for maximum drama.\n\n\n\n\nIn the five-block walk to the bakery, she gets a curious look from the fruit-stand owner, a smile from an older woman outside Fairway, and a possibly revolted side-eye from a mom in workout clothes, pushing a stroller containing a normally dressed baby boy. I want to blow my own cover, explain that I am actually just like her. “This is the first time she’s worn animal print!” I’d insist. “Except for a few times at my mother’s house on Long Island?!” But I hold my tongue, and my head high. Is this the persecution a Kardashi-baby suffers for daring to dress differently? I imagine Hayden and me showing these Upper West Side sheep how to walk on the wild-printed side once in a while.\n\n[#image: /photos/55f0149cfad0d98d444ce0bd]||||||\n\nAt the bakery, Hayden’s splashy appearance (or possibly her eagerness to say “hi” to the owner no less than eight times) earns her a free coconut macaroon. When she drops the crumbs all over herself, I don’t even care, because they are masked by all of the leopard. Again, I am persuaded that wearing Kardashian Kids translates to a certain star quality. Just like a Kardashian, Hayden is racking up free shit.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f0149cfad0d98d444ce0c1]|||\n“Wait, Jen and Justin got married? Are you sure this is the latest issue of *Life & Style*?” \n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n__Day 3: Sliding in Tulle__\n\nThe final day of dressing my baby in Kardashian Kids is comparatively vanilla. The [golden French Terry sweatshirt dress ($28.99)](http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=64919896&cp=2255957.2273447.32649916.33589946&parentPage=family), which a press release from Kardashian Kids notified me was recently worn by Kourtney’s daughter, __Penelope Disick__, is actually something I could see putting on Hayden. There’s something Carrie Bradshaw–ish about it, mixing terry cloth with tulle. (Like Carrie, Hayden is pocket-sized, charming, and prone to making everything all about her.)\n\n\nWe head to the local playground, where most children are wearing bathing suits and running through the sprinklers. The parents here don’t pay her much mind, probably assuming we are coming from church or something. Hayden is normally here in water shoes (aqua socks, if you will) and a Hello Kitty bathing suit. But given her fairly fancy outfit, I have to lead her away from the sprinklers, which causes her face to crumple into hysterical tears.\n\nGuilt washes over me. I feel like a pageant mom forcing my child’s toothless grin into a flipper. Overdressing your toddler to the point where they can’t play feels senseless. I wonder W.W.P.D.—What Would __Penelope Disick__ Do—in this situation? The answer is clear: probably not ever go to a public splash park.  \n\nWe shoulder on to the jungle gym, where we discover a silver lining to her outfit: the tulle skirt helps propel Hayden down the slide faster, to her delight. (Even though, by the time we leave, it’s streaked with sand and dirt.)\nOn the walk home, we pass a crush of sweaty people leaving SoulCycle. “Get it, girl,” one twentysomething hipster-y guy cheers Hayden, and, presumably her outfit. Not quite like the passionate, and dangerous, mob of fans that follow the real Kardashians. But an adoring fan nonetheless.\n\nI’m not sorry to peel off the dress and return her to a pastel-pink onesie and capri pants later that day. Kardashian Kids clothes are ultimately better suited for a Kardashian life—fancy and flashbulb-filled—than everyday, civilian childhood. I’d still prefer Hayden in stripes and ballet flats over faux fur and pleather leggings, and I’ll never again take her to the playground in tulle. But 72 hours in Kardashian Kids hardly scarred her for life. (She has yet to demand her own sock line, or a yacht trip to St. Barth’s.) In fact, it had its perks, including free cookies, fierce new dress-up and playground game, and perhaps, just maybe, a dash of unabashed Kardashian confidence? Though the fur of her capelet was faux, the baby swagger was real.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/553556a821478db3485e3862]||||||",
