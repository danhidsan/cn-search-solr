      "body":"Among the elites of French ballet, the *étoile* is the star around whom the entire performance revolves. She or he is named in a very public ceremony, in order to generate as much press and gossip as possible. She has survived yearly exams in which half of her classmates were summarily “fired.” Her movements are deemed the most pristine of all the survivors, above the principals, and far above the lowly ranks of beginner dancers—the quadrille. \n \nNow, Los Angeles photographer __Alex Prager__ pits an *étoile* against her stage fright, in a short film called *La Grande Sortie.* It was created in partnership with the Paris Opera, and launched as part of __3e Scène__, or “third stage,” a microsite that celebrates the Internet as the third platform for their performers (the first is the Palais Garnier, and the second is the Opéra Bastille, both in Paris). \nPrager, 35, has grown a cultish following with her portraits of actresses and models saturated in high Hollywood melodrama. Such are the emotional stakes of her portraits, which are often accompanied by short films, of stars including __Elizabeth Banks__, __[Jessica Chastain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8yE30-YLpg)__ afire in big, sultry red curls, and __Rooney Mara__ as Alex in *A Clockwork Orange*. In *La Grande Sortie,* Prager says she was inspired by her own experiences with speaking in public.\n\n\n\n \nMark Twain gave the dizzying set of symptoms a name, but according to the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, stage fright meets all the criteria of an anxiety disorder. British cultural theorist Nicholas Ridout suggested that, in the arts at least, stage fright became particularly pronounced when electric lights were introduced into European theaters in 1879. Suddenly, the performer was more exposed than ever, at the mercy of the crowd watching from the safety and anonymity of the dark. \n\n[#image: /photos/56018717ac079fd23782b055]||||||\n\n*La Grande Sortie* opens on an impatient crowd standing in line outside the Opéra Bastille. A middle-aged American couple argues about the lack of free refills in Paris (a conversation Prager says she actually heard in France, which she inserted into the film to signify her American interpretation of a French cultural institution). There is a murmur in the crowd that “it’s her first appearance as *étoile*, since she came back.” \n \nCut to the dancer herself, real-life *étoile* __Émilie Cozette,__ stalking the dimly lit passages backstage. She wears a dusty-blue dress whose color Prager lifted from the sash worn by the ballerina in the 1948 dark ballet classic, *The Red Shoes*. \n \nOn stage, amid a woodsy set typical of romantic fairytales, the *étoile* begins her slow and meticulous routine. Shots to the crowd show couples chatting, someone walking in an aisle, a loud cough—the usual minor annoyances. All is well, until she makes a minor mistake—she stumbles, just barely. But the *étoile*’s stage fright takes over. Her anxiety manifests in a frightening series of *pas de deux* with the previously bored audience members (played by retired dancers or teachers from the Paris Opera) yanking her about onstage in movements both violent and sublime. In an eerie coincidence, Cozette (goose-pimple good in this role), was also performing for the first time in about a year. It’s riveting and dark. \n\n\n[#iframe: https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrK5UEzCKf4](560x315)||||||\n\n \nPerfectionist thinking may be generally discouraged for its tendency to breed anxiety, but—to risk falling into ballet clichés—a certain level of anxiousness may be a job requirement for dancers. The pursuit of perfection is the *raison d’’être* from the time they start as children. \n \nThere is no cure for stage fright, only management—one of the things that establishes a professional from a wannabe. \n\nIt is probably also the reason for so much theater superstition. When she was designing the set, Prager says she struggled to get the hue of green she wanted. The set designer kept offering her different shades of turquoise or blue. “I was just like, is this a language barrier?” Prager says. “I sent him the exact color green: ‘This is what I want, and I don’t want anything different.’” Then he told her that the color green isn’t used on stage, because it’s considered bad luck. (In earlier times, toxic compounds in the green dye would sometimes make the actors sick and die.) \n \n“Performers will give their souls to each performance,” says Prager. “Then they might look out at the audience and see someone’s falling asleep. To some people it’s just another night and then they’ll go home and carry on with their lives. And for the performer I think it’s much more than that. If they’re really giving a good performance, it can be a moment in between life and death.” \n \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/5429af9471ac6d00725e87d4]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "body":"Our collectible-craved ancestors traveled thousands of miles to see relics of supposed body parts of the saints, so I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that there’s a rabid market out there for Titanic artifacts. *But how did they stay dry?,* you might ask. Well in the case of the last lunch menu served aboard, it was packed by passenger Abraham Lincoln Salomon (that name, right?), a stationer who thought it would be a good souvenir to bring along on Lifeboat No. 1. Remember Lifeboat No. 1? That’s the one that carried 12 mostly male passengers, in a boat fit for 40, after the captain announced women and children first, also known as the “money boat.” \n\n\nThe lunch menu, as well as two other artifacts from the Titanic, will be a part of [an auction by Lion Heart Autographs](http://www.ebay.com/clt/collectibles-live-events/titanic-artifacts-from-survivors-of-infamous-lifeboat-no-1-and-rare-historic-autographs-in-all-fields-no-buyer-s-premium-571400) available on the eBay Live Auction Platform, that kicks off at noon E.S.T. on September 30, along with a huge trove of other letters and papers attached to famous figures, including Margaret Mitchell’s letter to a fan turning down her suggestion of writing a sequel to *Gone with the Wind* and a sad note from a completely broke F. Scott Fitzgerald. But because we like things grouped in fives around here, we scoured eBay for two more Titanic artifacts, and here you have them.

Cheaper than the fancy-pants menu (being only slightly touched by Titanic hands), it’s still a decent prize, especially for whiners.

This one was used by Salomon to take notes, as it includes the names of the other passengers on Lifeboat No. 1 with him. There are only four known tickets from the weighing chair in existence, so don’t let this one pass you by, for just $7,500 to $10,000!\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5601870fac079fd23782b050]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n[__Possible piece of fabric (not a part of the Lion Heart auction)__](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Titanic-Baize-Fabric-Artifact-Fragment-from-Smoking-Room-/331651087044?hash=item4d37f1fac4)\n\nWhat we have here, ladies and gentleman, is a piece of green fabric *possibly* from the smoking room of the Titanic.

Take your chances, for just $399. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/560186f0873a015e454b14cf]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n[__Possible piece of wood from grand staircase (not a part of the Lion Heart auction)__](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Titanic-Authentic-Aft-Grand-Staircase-Wreck-Wood-Rare-museum-artifact-/161820085403?hash=item25ad3a8c9b)\n\n\neBay is telling me that this piece of wood is viewed once per hour—that’s a lot of demand for a triangle of wood with a three-inch hypotenuse (do NOT be fooled by claims of Titanic wood cut into rectangles, warns the lister). It is *believed* to have come from the ship’s grand staircase (cue Celine Dion), which explains the dramatic price tag of $7,200. Too high? A nice gentleman named Kevin Saucier at TitanicItems.com sells pieces of Titanic wood for just $86 a shingle. “Perfect for the collector on a budget.” You can’t make this stuff up—oh wait. \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/54cb0236b624d691057715ee]||||||\n\n\n",

In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, according to [the *Reporter*](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/sean-penn-files-10-million-826148), Penn seeks $10 million in damages; the lawsuit claims that Penn will “no longer tolerate the reckless and malicious behavior of others, who seek to aggrandize themselves or their projects at his expense.”\n\nDaniels is likely referring to Penn’s four-year marriage to Madonna; though the exes seem to now be on [pretty good terms](http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/madonna-sean-penn-finally-appreciates-her-art-after-30-f-king-years-2015219), stories of Penn’s alleged abuse during the union are hard to forget. Despite the charitable work Penn has done since then, on top of the two Oscars he’s won, many people can only remember the vivid story told in __Christopher Andersen’s__ [*Madonna: Unauthorized*](http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911106&slug=1315618) about Penn allegedly tying Madonna to a chair for hours and beating her. \n\nPenn has never been arrested or convicted for domestic violence; he has, however, been charged with assault [multiple times](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/sean-penn-charged-battery-vandalism-land-actor-jail-year-article-1.174725), and in 1987 served [33 days in jail](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/sean-penn-serial-killer) after assaulting a photographer. \n\nFor more on Madonna and Sean Penn’s tumultuous marriage, listen to [this episode](http://www.vidiocy.com/youmustrememberthispodcastblog/?offset=1420143060000) of the always-great podcast *You Must Remember This.* \n\n\n",

      "body":"__Pope Francis__ makes his own bed in the morning. So said his nephew in an interview in the Argentine press recently, and it’s the sort of detail—at once authentic and surprising—that captures the happy paradox of the man. Tagged as a “surprise” Pope when he was elected in 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio is as surprising as ever, but not because he’s a Jesuit or an Argentinian. The surprise is that he is authentic, a live person, and that he has managed to remain so in spite of “the pomp of the papacy, the crush of celebrity, and the expectations of the global Church,” as I heard from one Vatican insider after another while reporting in [“Our Man in the Vatican,”](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/09/pope-francis-usa-tour) the profile of Francis in October’s *Vanity Fair*: “‘He doesn’t “play” the Pope,’ says __Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli__, head of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications. ‘He is who he is.’”  \n \nIt’s his authenticity that makes him a Pope of this moment and that makes his U.S. visit seem out of the ordinary. At this point, papal visits to the U.S. are almost as regular as the election cycle. __Benedict XVI__ was here in 2008, and John Paul II came five times, spending nearly a month in all, following a precedent set when Paul VI celebrated Mass at Yankee Stadium while in New York for a single day: October 4, 1965. So why all the hullabaloo this time? Because this time the Pope is Francis, and he comes radiant with authenticity—authenticity of a kind that hardly seems possible for a public figure in a globalized age and media culture.  \n \nThis week, Francis won’t be making his own bed; surely his hosts the nuncios of Washington and New York and the archbishop of Philadelphia will see to it. And that is the challenge, even the conundrum, of this visit. At age 78, the affable and unaffected Pope comes for the first time to the world’s political and financial capitals, where power is the bitcoin of the realm and little is left to chance. The Pope, who thrives on spontaneity, comes with a schedule as tightly choreographed as any in his pontificate: more than 20 events in five days, including those at the White House, Congress, the United Nations, and Ground Zero. And the people’s Pontiff will be greeted by an accredited press corps of 8,000 and security forces said to be as formidable as any put in place since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon—on New York and Washington—14 years ago.   \n \nHow, in such a setting, could anybody let his authentic self show? If anybody can, it is Francis—but I think it’s fair to say that unless he can find a way to break through the cordons and act spontaneously, the visit will be a letdown.    \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f7078f200c34353591cf45]|||\nThe author meets the pope in Vatican City last march.\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe need is great. American public life is notably lacking in authenticity right now. The contenders for the Republican presidential nomination are a gaggle of calculating opportunists—so much so that __Donald Trump__ has been made out to be a paragon of true grit. On the Democrats’ side, e-mail-gate has given __Hillary Clinton__ a fresh opportunity to do what the Clintons do best: dissemble to the point where it seems even she doesn’t know what she thought and when she thought it. The candidate who has everything lacks the essential thing: authenticity; and her challengers have figured this out. Sure, he’s a socialist, but __Bernie Sanders__ has been embraced by the public as a combination of a Brooklyn Jew and a Vermont hippie—as a man who thinks and acts for himself. Likewise, __Joseph Biden.__ On __Stephen Colbert’s__ new show, the vice president made a run for the White House credible in 20 minutes simply by talking about his personal life candidly and without a script.  \n \nColbert is himself an exhibit of the situation, an authenticity meter in tailored suit and rimless glasses. The thrust of the new show is that, after seeing Colbert play a role for nine years on Comedy Central, now we get to see him as himself. He affirms his authenticity by presenting himself as a reformed phony, a former fake.  \n \nIt’s revealing that the one aspect of Colbert’s presentation to remain unchanged is his Catholicism.  When *The Colbert Report* first aired in 2005, remember, the Catholic Church was widely seen as one of the least credible institutions on the planet—an organization facing legal challenges on three continents for orchestrating campaigns of deceit and suppression about priestly sexual abuse. That Colbert was openly Catholic anyhow was a sign of his authenticity, a glimpse of the person behind the persona. Catholicism made him credible, and vice versa. \n \nSo it is now with Jorge Mario Bergoglio. “Is the Pope Catholic?” So goes the old piece of wit—a piece so stale that when *Newsweek* used it as a coverline last week, the cover looked like a *Daily Show* parody graphic. But that is the thrust of the harsh critique of Francis from the American right: that this liberal-accommodationist Jesuit, with his faux-naif persona, his offhand-seeming tolerance for people with “alternative lifestyles,” and his impolitic call for action on climate change, is something other than Catholic. \n \nAbout this, the right couldn’t be much more wrong. The fact is that for most of the people who will get a glimpse of him this week, Pope Francis seems authentic because he seems authentically Catholic—seems “a true Christian,” as pious folk used to say. The ready smile, the impatience with stuffy protocol, the unfeigned regard for other people and the reluctance to judge them harshly, the natural affinity for the poor, the sense that we should take no thought for the morrow because today’s cares are sufficient for today—these are character traits that people were raised to expect, and still do expect, from a person of faith.   \n \n“I am authentic, and so are you.” That is the message Francis expresses through all those close encounters in St. Peter’s Square—the selfies, the hugs, the hearty embraces of sick and elderly people, the moments when he breaks through the stylized ritual of the papal audience to meet a few pilgrims face to face. Can he express it this week, with just about every minute scheduled and every move scrutinized by reporters and arms-bearing security guys? Surely he\ncan. The question is how. Monday in Cuba, addressing a group of young people in Spanish, he showed his authenticity by setting aside the script to speak extemporaneously. (“I’m not sure if in Cuba they use this word, but in Argentina we say, ‘Don’t be wimpy. Open yourselves and dream.’”)   Because his English is limited, he will speak mainly Spanish in the U.S.; if he goes off script in Washington, his remarks will await translation.\n \nI figure that there may be a surprise Tuesday evening. Francis is due to arrive at Joint Base Andrews at four o’clock and to take part in a welcoming ceremony at the base. The rest of the evening is open. This is probably for reasons of protocol: Francis will receive a proper welcome from __President Obama__ at the White House Wednesday morning, and it would be tactless for a scheduled event to precede the president’s. Possibly the night is open so that Francis can rest and pray before the demanding wall-to-wall events of the days to follow. In any case, there’s an opening for an unscripted encounter—say, maté tea with Argentinians who live and work in the city, or a spotlit drop-by at the Lincoln Memorial, or evening prayer with the Jesuit community in a darkened chapel.   \n \nHere’s hoping that Francis, known as the Pope who carries his own bag, comes bearing his knack for surprises.\n\n*Paul Elie, a senior fellow in Georgetown’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, is the author of* The Life You Save May Be Your Own *and* Reinventing Bach. *In 2014, on the 25th anniversary of the publication of* The Satanic Verses, *Elie [wrote about author](http://www.vanityfair.com/unchanged/2014/05/salman-rushdie-ian-mcwean-martin-amis-satanic-verses-fatwa) Salman Rushdie and the controversy surrounding the novel. He has reported from the Vatican since 1998.*\n\n[__RELATED__: He Believed in Miracles](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/06/cornwell200506)\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/5429ac990b6619b370eb90ff]||||||\n\n\n",

      "body":"Since its first trailer debuted, and maybe even before that, *Stonewall*, __Roland Emmerich’s__ dramatization of the 1969 riots at Stonewall Inn, a seismic event credited with kicking off the modern gay-rights movement, has been met with dread. Partly because, yes, it’s Roland Emmerich, the mega-schlock auteur behind disaster flicks like *The Day After Tomorrow*, *Independence Day*, and *2012*, and outright disasters like *Godzilla*. He’s certainly a strange fit for a piece of relevant political rabble-rousing. (*Day After Tomorrow* could *maybe* be seen as a climate-change call to action, but then the C.G.I. wolves show up.) So, there was some trepidation about that, certainly.\n\nBut more troubling was how Emmerich seemed to be framing the story, with __Jeremy Irvine__ playing some beautiful, blond angel from the Midwest, sent to the Village to marshall the non-white, gender-queer street kids into action. Which, y’know, is certainly not how the Stonewall riots, which were largely incited by drag queens and trans women of color and lesbians, actually happened. And yet there was Irvine in the trailer, looking corn-fed and fit in a white T-shirt, while various characters closer to the demographic of the real Stonewall rioters slinked around him in the dark. So, there was hue and cry about that, as well there should have been. \n\nSome dumb part of me, though, found myself giving *Stonewall*, and Emmerich, the benefit of the doubt. I rather enjoyed Emmerich’s other recent out-of-the-box film, the surprisingly affecting 2011 Shakespeare-authorship drama *Anonymous*, a piece of historical hogwash that was nonetheless lovingly, thoughtfully made. Maybe Emmerich could bring the same personal sensitivity to *Stonewall*, a movie he’s reportedly wanted to make for a long time. Plus, in 2015 a movie couldn’t be *that* tone-deaf about its politics and its optics, right? Surely they were just using sort-of-a-name Jeremy Irvine to advertise the film, while in actuality, the movie is the fair, appropriately representative ensemble piece that a story like this requires. That was my naïve hope, anyway.\n\nTurns out, *Stonewall* is perhaps even *worse* than some feared it would be—more offensive, more white-washed, even more hackishly made. It’s so bad that it’s hard to know where to begin a catalogue of the film’s sins. Maybe you start with its leering, bizarrely sex-shaming tone, which has poor cherubic baby-hunk Danny (Irvine)—kicked out of his house by his football-coach father after he’s caught giving the quarterback, yes the quarterback, a blow job—being preyed upon by gross, sweaty, teen-hungry older men upon arriving in New York. In two different scenes, Danny cries pitifully as one of these horrible, horrible men (one of them in grotesque drag) fellate him. (He needs the money, and is then turned out against his will.) Danny shuns the advances of any younger man who isn’t strapping and white, particularly those of __Jonny Beauchamp’s__ Ray/Ramona, a queer Latino street kid who has a big crush on pretty-boy Danny. \n\nRather horrifically, it’s taken as a given, an implicit fact, that Danny could never, ever fall in love with, or have sex with, someone like swishy, gender-fluid Ray. No, no, people like Ray are meant to forever pine in the shadows for American godlings like Danny. But when __Jonathan Rhys Meyers’s__ character successfully seduces Danny, while playing “A Whiter Shade of Pale” on a jukebox no less, it’s understood to be O.K., because he’s at least a somewhat masculine white guy. In that scene, Emmerich keeps cutting back to Ray’s sad expression as he watches the seduction happen, and though Danny is largely meant to be the audience’s safe, easy stand-in, in that scene I think Emmerich wants us to sympathize with Ray. \n\nBecause surely we all wish we could be with a Bel-Ami certified twunk like Danny, right? Well some of us do, sure, but of course plenty of other people are instead into what Ray is selling, or any of the other non-white or non-butch hustlers who populate *Stonewall* but get only a minimal, pat-on-the-head kind of attention. The movie could never even consider such a possibility, though. Here is a startlingly direct exercising of entitlement: “Yeah, I know in real life it happened to *those* people, but wouldn’t it be better if it happened to someone like *this*?” \n\n*Stonewall* insists, with its hokey story about Danny’s personal growth and struggles with his family back home in Indiana, that what actually happened isn’t good enough. That no one will care unless there’s a beautiful young white man at the center of the story. Because who is more wonderful, compelling, appealing than that? Which may sadly be the opinion of certain corners of the market, but who cares about those people. They have plenty of movies made for them. Meanwhile, there are plenty other recent movies that *aren’t* catered to their narrow tastes but that have done just fine. \n\nWhat this really is, I think, is the filmmakers tending to their personal preferences and prejudices, and then blaming the system. Darn it, this is how it *has* to be, because that’s how the world is. We have to literally see a black character *hand Danny a brick* so Danny can be the first to throw it and the first to cheer “Gay power!” (This is the moment my screening audience, of professional critics, was lost to groans and laughter for the rest of the movie.) We simply must redirect as much history as possible through a white, bizarrely heteronormative lens, or else, the thinking goes, no one will care. People like Emmerich throw up their hands at this supposed inevitability and say, “That’s just the way it is.” \n\nWhich, of course, is nonsense. When *Straight Outta Compton* is earning $60 million on its opening weekend, it’s nonsense. When *Tangerine* is earning rave reviews and art-house dollars, it’s nonsense. When a show like *Transparent* is winning Emmys, it’s nonsense. But *Stonewall* demands that we accept Emmerich’s evasive, self-serving sociology and then has the audacity to ask that we be moved by it. We’re not. \n\nAside from its offensiveness, *Stonewall* is, plain and simple, a terribly made movie, with an alarmingly clunky script by acclaimed playwright __Jon Robin Baitz__ (“I’m too angry to love anyone right now” is one howler—of course delivered by Danny to poor, still pining Ray) and a production design that makes late 1960s Christopher Street look like *Sesame Street*. The story plunks along, until the riots rather unceremoniously, and confusingly, begin, and then the movie hobbles lamely to a close, giving us a resolution to the family-strife plot that’s the least interesting thing in the movie. Emmerich takes one of the most politically charged periods of the last century and turns it into a bland, facile coming-of-age story. \n\nThroughout all this, Irvine looks good in the aforementioned T-shirt, but that’s about all he does. Beauchamp at least offers some glimmers of life, but Ray is so tragically, meanly written that there’s only so much that can be done to turn him into a human. Real-life Stonewall hero Marsha P. Johnson only gets a little screen time, and is played as comic relief, flatly, by __Otoja Abit.__ Many of the characters who don’t look and sound like Danny are rendered as jokes, silly people who need Danny’s relatively rugged masculinity to get them angry and organized. *Stonewall* is ultimately yet another cartoonish fantasy about white saviors and square-jawed heroes; it should be called *Independence Gay*. \n\nMaybe it’s asking too much to get a smart, accurate Stonewall movie. After all, a heck of a lot of straight history has been schmaltzified by Hollywood, neatly edited and tidied up, so why shouldn’t gay history get the same shitty treatment? But that this film was directed by a gay man, written by a gay man, with an obvious intent to educate, uplift, and inspire, in this particular political climate, and is *still* so maddeningly, stultifyingly bungled serves only to show us how ridiculous the concept of a monolithic “gay community” really is. *Stonewall* at least does that bit of good: it illustrates how systems of privilege and prejudice within a minority can be just as pervasive and ugly as anything imposed from the outside. And that’s an outrage. So how long until someone throws a brick through the screen?",
