      "body":"We already know that __Jennifer Lawrence__ sent __Amy Schumer__ [a congratulatory text message](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/jennifer-lawrence-amy-schumer-emmys-text-message) after the comedian’s [Emmy win](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/emmys-2015-winners) on Sunday night. \n\nAnd on Monday, it seems as though the Oscar-winning actress showered her new [close friend](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/jennifer-lawrence-amy-schumer-vacation-photos), [vacation mate](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/07/jennifer-lawrence-amy-schumer-vacation-pictures), fellow [__Billy Joel__ back-up dancer](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/jennifer-lawrence-amy-schumer-billy-joel-concert-uptown-girl), and [screenwriting partner](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/jennifer-lawrence-amy-schumer-movie-sisters) with more celebratory love.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Schumer posted the below Instagram along with the telling caption, “Never tell Jennifer L your room number.”\n\n[#instagram: https://instagram.com/p/76MGUbKUO5/?taken-by=amyschumer]\n\nJudging by the photo it looks as though Schumer, possibly nursing [the hangover she was aiming for](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/emmys-2015-amy-schumer-game-of-thrones) last night, returned to her hotel room to find the J.Law equivalent of a grand, Kimye-style gesture of affection. Instead of [a room full of roses](http://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/people/2015/05/11/27107837/), the Oscar winner had Schumer’s room filled with oversized balloons. (The only thing that would have been better, we argue: a five-foot cake that Lawrence jumped out of.)\n\nOn Sunday, Schumer used the [Emmy red carpet](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/emmys-2015-amy-schumer-red-carpet) to clarify that she and Lawrence are not exactly Best Friends Forever, even if the Internet has cast them as such in its fan fiction. \n\n“We really like each other, but I think the media blew it up,” told [E!’s __Marc Malkin__](http://www.eonline.com/news/698112/amy-schumer-and-jennifer-lawrence-are-not-bffs-and-that-s-ok) on Sunday. “We’re not B.F.F.s. We’re just Fs, but we’re really good Fs.\n\n“I have B.F.F.s since I was 8 years old so it’ll be tough to uproot them,” the *Trainwreck* star explained.\n\nSchumer also gave an update on [the screenplay that she is writing with Lawrence](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/jennifer-lawrence-amy-schumer-movie-sisters), revealing that the duo are already on the third or fourth draft of their comedy, which centers on two sisters that the actresses plan on playing themselves.\n\nWhen Schumer wasn’t making the Emmy red carpet [her own private party](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/emmys-2015-amy-schumer-red-carpet) or [winning some serious hardware](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/emmys-2015-winners) last night, our new comedy queen was [photobombing the *Game of Thrones* cast and reminiscing about her year’s many highlights](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/emmys-2015-amy-schumer-game-of-thrones).\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55ff33463a02e0b16051db54]||||||\n\n\n",

      "body":"For all the benefits of celebrity-dom—getting every item on the menu brought to your table at a restaurant (we assume), getting a screener of any movie you want just by texting your assistant (we imagine), getting to go backstage at any concert you attend (we are pretty sure)—there are, of course, a whole bunch of well-known drawbacks: the paparazzi, the tabloid coverage, and a sudden difficulty in knowing who among your friends and family you can trust.\n \nIt is this last pitfall that has befallen __Ryan Reynolds__, as the husband of __Blake Lively__ and [father of young James](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-daughter-name-james) has [told *GQ*](http://www.gq.com/story/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-gq-cover), in its October issue, that he was betrayed by one of his best friends, after his wife gave birth to their daughter. “A guy that I’d known for my whole life, one of my closest friends growing up, he had been shopping pictures of my baby around,” Reynolds said. “I kind of got in front of it, which is good. But it was a slightly dark period. A bad couple of weeks. . . . It was like a death. It was like one of those devastating things to find out.” (Neither Lively nor Reynolds has shared any photos of James since she was born in December of last year.)\n \nReynolds went on, discussing this former friend’s motives: “[He or she did it] just for money. I mean, I don’t think he thought he would ever be caught. But it’s a pretty narrow group of people that I would send photos like that to. They’re just, like, my closest family and my closest friends: ‘Here’s us in the delivery room!’ . . .  It was, like, so kind of shocking. There isn’t really a conversation to have. It’s just, ‘Oh, well, now I’m never going to see you or talk to you again, unfortunately.’ That’s kind of how it worked out.”\n \nThis is sad, and also feels like it could be the premise for a rich play, or orchestral piece, or something. Also, whoever this person is, one imagines he or she could—now with nothing to lose, and an even higher “profile”—sell their story to *In Touch*, or whatever (“Spurned by Blake and Ryan!”), though we shall hope, for the sake of the Lively-Reynolds joint psyche, that he or she does not. And lastly, perhaps this is a weird analogy, but this whole tale is just making us want to see photos of James Reynolds *even more*, like in the way that watching *Super Size Me* made us crave fast food.\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/5579fc09ca2dc24e4d26867c]||||||\n\n\n",

Her nomination alone made history as well; with both Davis and  *Empire*’s __Taraji P. Henson__ nominated, it was the first time the category for lead actress in a drama series had ever included multiple women of color as nominees. Henson, whom Davis mentioned in her speech, was on her feet in support: \n\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/wtfelias/status/645791340626751488]\n\n\n\n\n\nDavis clearly knew the historical impact of her win, too, even opening her speech with a quote from Harriet Tubman (whom she’ll soon play in an [HBO biopic](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/04/viola-davis-harriet-tubman). “You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there,“ she said onstage, acknowledging that it was not a lack of talent that had kept a black woman from winning this award until now. “The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity.”\n \nWhen *How to Get Away with Murder* and later *Empire* premiered last season, it seemed to mark a potential permanent shift toward diversity in television, especially when *Empire* became such a phenomenal hit. Led by powerful behind-the-scenes forces __Shonda Rhimes__ and __Lee Daniels,__ respectively, both shows (riding a wave created by Rhimes’s other shows, *Scandal* and *Grey’s Anatomy*) combined soapy dramatics with a diverse cast in a way that felt genuinely new, especially at a time when network television struggles to compete with cable and streaming. Along with the season’s comedy hits *Jane the Virgin*, *Black-ish*, and *Fresh Off the Boat*, these shows seemed to prove that expanding the voices and faces presented on television was the best way for networks to hang on to their relevance.\n \nDavis’s win tonight should only increase that faith in diversity for the future of television. But her victory is far from a problem solved; it has been 14 years since a man of color, __Andre Braugher,__ was nominated for outstanding lead actor in a drama series. On the comedy side, things are a bit more promising; both __Don Cheadle__ and __Anthony Anderson__ were nominated for lead actor in a comedy this year, while __America Ferrera__ was the last woman of color to win a lead actress in a comedy Emmy, in 2007. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55ff33463a02e0b16051db54]||||||\n\n\n\n\n",

There’s just so much TV, and the whims of the television Academy voters seem fickler than their movie counterparts. \n\nThat said, there were a few predictable outcomes: it didn’t seem possible that Jon Hamm wouldn’t win for his final season as Don Draper on *Mad Men*, an inarguably iconic performance that was, previously, overlooked for flashier work. And so he did finally pick up a trophy. It seemed inevitable, too, that __Julia Louis Dreyfus__ would win for *Veep*, as her performance on that masterwork has only gotten deeper, more nuanced four seasons in. Plus, the Academy just loves J.L.D., as do we. __Jeffrey Tambor,__ making history as the first actor to win an Emmy playing a transgender character, also felt, despite its revolutionariness, a foregone conclusion. \n\nOtherwise, though, the night was full of uncertainty. Would *Modern Family* break a record in winning best comedy for a fifth time? Would *Mad Men* cap its run with a final win? Turns out no, with *Veep* and, for the first time, *Game of Thrones* sweeping in to further gild HBO’s mantle. Which, Katey, doesn’t sit exactly right with me. Because both of those shows had perhaps their weakest seasons yet, particularly *Game of Thrones*. \n\nBeleaguered by unnecessary scenes of rape and other debasements of women, the fifth season of *Game of Thrones* veered away from __George R.R. Martin’s__ books into more sensationalistic, prurient territory. It’s still a prodigiously made show, with the richest, most carefully realized production design perhaps in television history. And the cast remains stellar, a fact well-represented by __Peter Dinklage’s__ win tonight. But narratively, this year the show lost the depth of seasons past, despite a very strong start in the first few episodes. It would have been nice to see *Mad Men* walk away with an Emmy instead, for a strange and satisfying final season, or *Orange Is the New Black*, which, despite its messiness and unevenness, is a show thrillingly unlike anything that’s ever been on television. (And was in the drama category for the first time this year.)\n\n*Veep* I’ve got less of a quibble with, but compared to the slow, beautiful build of *Silicon Valley*’s second season, or the manic joy of *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt*’s first, I’m just not sure that __Armando Iannucci’s__ brilliant political satire really measured up this year. Its jokes just felt the *tiniest* bit flatter than they did at the show’s caustic height. A win for *Veep* will always be a win for quality television, but the show was better in previous seasons, I think. And, I’d argue, other comedies were sharper this year. \n\nKatey, what do you think? Did the right shows win? Did the right actors win? Does any of it matter, or should we just talk about __Adrien Brody’s__ wonderful mispronunciation of __Elisabeth Moss’s__ name for the rest of the night? “Elizabeths Moths” may have won the evening, I think. \n\n__Katey Rich:__ I agree with you that Elizabeths Moths is my new favorite actor, and would also like to submit __Taraji P. Henson’s__ visible frustration with __Terrence Howard__ for next year’s outstanding drama series Emmy. God bless awards shows, not for the awards they give us, but for all the interstitial moments of unvarnished celebrity that feel, for a second at least, like something real.\n\nI hear your complaints about *Veep* and *Game of Thrones* (though *Veep*, for me, has never been less than perfect). I think that, even though both of these shows are new winners, we’re running into the problem the Emmys have year after year—sticking to the same favorites beyond any rational point, which means they’re very, very slow in changing their allegiances. *Game of Thrones*’s win tonight could just as easily have been for the Battle of Blackwater or the Red Wedding, since when those episodes actually aired the Emmys were too wrapped up in other shows. And *Veep* mercifully ended the *Modern Family* streak that defied all logic. Sure, *Frasier* winning year after year was obnoxious, but fine when its competition was *3rd Rock From the Sun*. But the fact that Emmy voters let *Modern Family* continue winning in our ongoing glut of TV was just nonsense. \n\nSo while __Amy Schumer’s__ win for best sketch show was very of-the-moment, and their embrace of freshman series *Transparent* welcomely quick, the Emmys were in many ways their same old selves—reluctant to embrace the new until it’s *really* proven itself, and maybe by then gone a bit downhill. (Though, I reiterate, *Veep* is still perfect.) What I like about these awards is that, with so many prizes handed out, it usually feels like justice is being served anyway. Do you agree? Do statues for Jon Hamm and Jeffrey Tambor make up for the torpor?\n\n__Richard:__ They do make up for the torpor some, yes, but here’s what more than made up for it: __Regina King__ and [__Viola Davis__](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/viola-davis-emmy) winning big trophies, two actresses *long* deserving of accolades who are finally finding their awards footing in their 40s and 50s. I was also [really excited](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/09/olive-kitteridge-emmys-win) to see something as small and, frankly, difficult as *Olive Kitteridge* pick up a whole host of wins. The Emmys are sprawling. So you’re right, Katey, that there’s more opportunity to get things right than there is at the Oscars. \n\nNot everything deserving can win, of course. But complaining about worthy shows like *Game of Thrones* and *Veep* winning big awards is, really, representative of our embarrassment of TV riches. There’s just so much good stuff on the air these days, so any groaning, barring a tedious *Modern Family* win, is nitpicking. I think the Emmys are moving in the right direction, just maybe not, as you said, at the pace that us non-voters are. \n\nSo, despite some minor gripes, tonight was a toast to good TV. But mostly, it was a toast to Elizabeths Moths. \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55ff33463a02e0b16051db54]||||||\n\n\n",
