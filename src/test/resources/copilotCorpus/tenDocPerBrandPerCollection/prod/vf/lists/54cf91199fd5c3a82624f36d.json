      "body":"As one of the few humans on Earth who un-ironically calls himself a “TV magic obsessive,” let me tell you, there’s never been a magic show on television like *Penn & Teller: Fool Us.* \n\nI approach the show from several perspectives. As a layperson, it’s entertaining as hell with a clear-cut premise. *Fool Us* is a magic competition on the CW Television Network  in which performers try to fool __Penn Jillette__ and __Teller__ as to how their trick was done. If they succeed, the aspiring magicians win an opening-act slot in the duo’s longtime Las Vegas show. The show has been a surprise ratings hit in its Monday primetime slot, averaging 2 million viewers (it’s been renewed for a third season).\n\nI also watch the show as a guy interested in magic since age six. I’m comfortable saying *Fool Us* has advanced the art form within popular culture better than any televised magic show in recent memory. The variety of magic subgenres given the spotlight is encouraging for those of us who don’t perform with live tigers: there’ve been acts of coin and card magic, mind-reading, escapology, quick change (where costumes transform in a flash)—even a man who solves Rubik’s cubes, *magically.*\n\nAfter each magician’s performance, Penn and Teller confer, and using their combined century of conjuring know-how, try to work out the trick’s method without revealing its secret. This postmortem is the most fascinating part of the show. Listen to how Penn (and Teller, in his silent advisory role) discuss insider terms, something considered by some magicians as heresy. Terms like “cooler,” “McCombical decks,” “Tamariz,” and “Aronson” are of little meaning to 99.997 percent of the viewing audience, and indeed, host __Jonathan Ross__ would often express a quizzical, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” But to hear allusions to method in a public forum, even with such cryptic jargon, certainly breaks new ground for magic on television.\n\nIn the clip below, a magician manages to get one by Penn and Teller—and piss off Penn by doing so:\n\n\n[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCFXV6o7cro](854x480)||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are those who view Penn and Teller as magic turncoats, because they dare to allow the public in on a method or two. (In one of their best-known routines, they perform the “cups and balls” trick with clear plastic cups, ostensibly showing where the sleight of hand takes place.) These are the magicians whose relationship with secrets is ironclad: if you even once reveal the workings of a trick, you’re excommunicated from the fraternity.\n\nIn the magic community, you’ll find backlash to the show for the aforementioned reasons, but most magicians I know view *Fool Us* as a net positive. It has nothing to do with fooling audiences. Really, the phrase “fool us” is the pithy elevator pitch to get on network television. The greater motivation of the show, I think, is having experienced magicians cogently articulate the merits of a performance, which in turn helps the lay public better appreciate magic. Trust me, you’re better off having Penn and Teller explain what’s good about a magic act than Scary Spice or __Howie Mandel.__ \n\nI spoke with Teller (now his full legal name), the famously silent partner of Penn, about *Fool Us*, magic, and the sanctity of secrets.\n\n__*Vanity Fair:* Having a magic show called *Fool Us* would lead most to believe the end goal of magic is to fool someone. I suspect your motivation is more nuanced than that.__\n\n*Teller*: What’s the end goal for any work of art? The answer is it’s not one thing. In almost every work of art there is on one level—and this is the level at which magic is, I think, the most fundamental—at which you must amaze the audience. When you’re an actor, you must, for the moment you’re there, convince the audience that you are possessed by the spirit of this character. And there is a level in which you go, “Wow, I really thought for that moment, that the character onstage was Hamlet.” That amazement is the bottom line of any work of art.\n\n__Magicians get into magic because they’re seduced by the feeling of amazement. The ironic thing is, the deeper they dive into magic, the less often they get fooled. That seems immeasurably cruel.__\n\nThe deeper you get into magic, the more profound your amazement becomes. There’s an intermediary stage where you go, “Oh, is that all there is? It was just a thread?” And then when you work with a thread for four years, and you work out what must exactly be done to make that thread into something that is profound and difficult to imagine could be the cause of whatever it is you’re doing to it, you veer right into a different kind of amazement. It’s the amazement of the knowledgeable person. It’s the amazement of the astronomer who has studied everything about the stars that is available, and who sees and understands the mechanisms that we know about, but is able to appreciate how mysterious it all is in the larger picture.\n\n__So you can be just as amazed by the thought process that goes into creating a trick?__\n\nThere’s a trick I do in our live show based loosely on David P. Abbott’s Floating Ball. I experimented with that trick for 18 months to come up with a routine in which the idea was no longer the ball was going to float, but the ball was coming to life. I spend one hour onstage every night after my show experimenting. And the more I experimented, the more wondrous the situation got for me. I was no longer wondering at the same thing the audience was wondering at. I was in astonishment at how the simple idea of a thread with an angle of something riding on it; the variety of incredible illusory movements it could provide. \n\nPenn introduces that trick in our show by saying, “Now here’s a trick that’s done with a piece of thread.” We say that ahead of time because what we discovered was an audience accustomed to elaborate mechanical and electronic modes of propulsion was inclined to think the movement of this red ball was just some sort of remote-control thing. Whereas magicians who knew how the trick was done appreciated the fact that at every moment, I was disproving the possibility of the thread that they knew was there. So by letting the audience in on the fact that it was done by means of a thread, we created more amazement.\n\n__The fact you let people in on the modus operandi makes it no longer feel like a confrontational relationship with the audience. The magician isn’t saying, “I’m superior to you because I fooled you,” but, “Let’s share in this amazing moment.”__\n\nLong ago, when we originated our clear “cups and balls” routine, we were taken to task by a number of magicians who said, “You’re exposing the cups and balls!” What they didn’t realize was the trick did not originate with the idea of exposure. The trick originated . . . I’ll demonstrate for you . . . \n\n[*We’re sitting at a bar, and Teller gets a clear cup and balls of aluminum foil from a nearby table.*]\n\nPenn and I were sitting in a diner, and I was messing around with rolled-up napkins. As I’m talking I’ll often fiddle with stuff. I noticed that when I did that move, one didn’t see the load, even though it was in full view.\n\n[*Teller makes one ball disappear from his hand, and it reappears inside the clear plastic cup sitting on the table.*]\n\nThat phenomenon of your attention being taken away from something by a very natural action seemed to be truly, profoundly amazing. The subject for a piece of magic. So we developed a routine with clear cups, but of course, it would seem pretentious for us to say, “Note how you could both see the secret action and the ostensible action at the same time! Isn’t that an interesting counterpoint?” So we decided to present it as though it was an exposé, and magicians of course being terribly naïve, believed us. \n\nWe were taken to task by one magician who came to our show and took a swing at Penn in the lobby for the evil that we were doing. Penn said, “Why don’t we just go to the diner and have a chat?” So this magician sat down with us and said, “All right, whose side are *you* on anyway?” That’s the fundamental problem with much of magical performance. Merely because a magician is trying to create a moment in which a spectator is astounded, the magicians often conceive of themselves as being in opposition to their audience. That is something Penn and I are violently against. We do not believe the audience is stupid. We believe many, many, many, many—perhaps most of the audience—is a great deal smarter than we are. Therefore, they need to be shown the respect to be treated as peers.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/56004f76accf6caa52fb8da9]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n__Are magicians a territorial bunch?__\n\nThere’s an aesthetic rule in magic that to allow the audience to be amazed, you don’t explain your trick. That part of your job is to withhold and conceal certain pieces of information in order to bring the audience to a level of astonishment. It is an aesthetic rule, not a moral rule. However, it has gradually seeped into magic lore as being a moral rule. “Giving away a trick is an evil deed.” No it’s not! The person who wrote the magic book that got you started in magic gave away a trick. Was that an evil deed? No!\n\nIn *Tim’s Vermeer*, our friend Tim Jenison believes that he has discovered the method by which Vermeer got such photo-realistic effects. Knowing that does not in any way diminish my astonishment at looking at a Vermeer painting. Alexander Pope wrote, “A little learning is a dangerous thing/ drink deep, or not taste the Pierian spring.” He’s talking about exactly that. A little learning can spoil magic. A lot of learning enhances it.\n\n__Let’s talk about *Fool Us*. What’s your end goal for the show?__\n\nOne of the problems with magic on television is home viewers generally have a feeling the depiction of the magical event is being slanted by the way it’s shot. Anyone who claims they can watch a piece of magic without trying to figure out how it’s done is lying. One of the fundamental joys of magic is it’s an intellectual art form at one level, and as a viewer, you’re trying to reconcile what you see with what you know. The joy of it is going, “That’s impossible! No it can’t be. Yes it is! No it can’t be. Yes it is!” And these two things are colliding—what you see is colliding with what you know. The sparks are coming from this dissonance between what all of your experience tells you and what you’re presently experiencing. The joy of that dissonance is considerable. \n\nBut when you see it on television, you never feel that. “I’m not here in the room, I couldn’t control where my eyes are going.” Part of what *Fool Us* is designed to do is, without saying it, is to say what you’re seeing is really what somebody in the theater is seeing. We do that by focusing on this one silly and trivial aspect of magic, which is, how’s the trick done? We don’t even know what acts are going to be on the show. We’re genuinely trying to see if we can figure out what’s going on. \n\n\n\n__The most interesting part of the show is after each performance, Penn talks in this magician doublespeak to clue in the audience to the trick’s method. How much of this is trying to maintain the secret, and how much is coding to teenagers interested in magic where they can learn these techniques?__\n\nIt’s all of that. When Penn talks about magic, he tries not to spoil the trick for the home audience—that takes away the fun for people who want to watch it over and over again, or people just delighted by the effect. So Penn deliberately uses jargon terms that will communicate to the magician and to the community of magicians that we do know indeed what’s going on, without wrecking the trick for the home audience. \n\nThere also really is, precisely, a way to encourage people who are interested in magic to learn more. If we say, “Does the term ‘breather crimp’ mean anything to you?” That takes somebody who might be really interested in card magic to Google “breather crimp,” and they’re going to learn a really cool thing that they might be able to use.\n\n__Much of magic is now consumed on YouTube. Do you now have to come up with tricks that could withstand multiple replays? Does this change the way you create magic?__\n\nIt sometimes does, and it sometimes doesn’t. For example, the tricks we do on *Fool Us* are generally tricks we’ve done in our live shows. They’re polished enough that they deceive and amaze a live audience. If you rewind it a zillion times and study them out, maybe you could figure out what’s going on here. That doesn’t bother me. I’m just providing more entertainment for you. It’s levels of participation that are now allowed by recording that we didn’t have in former times. If you watch it a zillion times and you go, “I think it happened right there,” that’s a delight for you!\n\n__The sanctity of secrets: Are the secrets as sacrosanct today as they were to a past generation?__\n\nTo some people. I’m mystified by the obsession of popular writers with magic secrets. Everyone who writes about magic should read [author] Jim Steinmeyer’s description of magic secrets. He says the most important secret in magic is that most people believe there’s a safe somewhere that contains all the magic secrets that’s heavily guarded and carefully locked. The biggest secret magicians have to keep is that that safe is empty.\n\n[Related: 72 Hours Inside the Eye-Popping World of Cardistry](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/04/cardistry-con-2015)\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/553676f421478db3485e6130]||||||",

      "body":"Among the elites of French ballet, the *étoile* is the star around whom the entire performance revolves. She or he is named in a very public ceremony, in order to generate as much press and gossip as possible. She has survived yearly exams in which half of her classmates were summarily “fired.” Her movements are deemed the most pristine of all the survivors, above the principals, and far above the lowly ranks of beginner dancers—the quadrille. \n \nNow, Los Angeles photographer __Alex Prager__ pits an *étoile* against her stage fright, in a short film called *La Grande Sortie.* It was created in partnership with the Paris Opera, and launched as part of __3e Scène__, or “third stage,” a microsite that celebrates the Internet as the third platform for their performers (the first is the Palais Garnier, and the second is the Opéra Bastille, both in Paris). \nPrager, 35, has grown a cultish following with her portraits of actresses and models saturated in high Hollywood melodrama. Such are the emotional stakes of her portraits, which are often accompanied by short films, of stars including __Elizabeth Banks__, __[Jessica Chastain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8yE30-YLpg)__ afire in big, sultry red curls, and __Rooney Mara__ as Alex in *A Clockwork Orange*. In *La Grande Sortie,* Prager says she was inspired by her own experiences with speaking in public.\n\n\n\n \nMark Twain gave the dizzying set of symptoms a name, but according to the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, stage fright meets all the criteria of an anxiety disorder. British cultural theorist Nicholas Ridout suggested that, in the arts at least, stage fright became particularly pronounced when electric lights were introduced into European theaters in 1879. Suddenly, the performer was more exposed than ever, at the mercy of the crowd watching from the safety and anonymity of the dark. \n\n[#image: /photos/56018717ac079fd23782b055]||||||\n\n*La Grande Sortie* opens on an impatient crowd standing in line outside the Opéra Bastille. A middle-aged American couple argues about the lack of free refills in Paris (a conversation Prager says she actually heard in France, which she inserted into the film to signify her American interpretation of a French cultural institution). There is a murmur in the crowd that “it’s her first appearance as *étoile*, since she came back.” \n \nCut to the dancer herself, real-life *étoile* __Émilie Cozette,__ stalking the dimly lit passages backstage. She wears a dusty-blue dress whose color Prager lifted from the sash worn by the ballerina in the 1948 dark ballet classic, *The Red Shoes*. \n \nOn stage, amid a woodsy set typical of romantic fairytales, the *étoile* begins her slow and meticulous routine. Shots to the crowd show couples chatting, someone walking in an aisle, a loud cough—the usual minor annoyances. All is well, until she makes a minor mistake—she stumbles, just barely. But the *étoile*’s stage fright takes over. Her anxiety manifests in a frightening series of *pas de deux* with the previously bored audience members (played by retired dancers or teachers from the Paris Opera) yanking her about onstage in movements both violent and sublime. In an eerie coincidence, Cozette (goose-pimple good in this role), was also performing for the first time in about a year. It’s riveting and dark. \n\n\n[#iframe: https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrK5UEzCKf4](560x315)||||||\n\n \nPerfectionist thinking may be generally discouraged for its tendency to breed anxiety, but—to risk falling into ballet clichés—a certain level of anxiousness may be a job requirement for dancers. The pursuit of perfection is the *raison d’’être* from the time they start as children. \n \nThere is no cure for stage fright, only management—one of the things that establishes a professional from a wannabe. \n\nIt is probably also the reason for so much theater superstition. When she was designing the set, Prager says she struggled to get the hue of green she wanted. The set designer kept offering her different shades of turquoise or blue. “I was just like, is this a language barrier?” Prager says. “I sent him the exact color green: ‘This is what I want, and I don’t want anything different.’” Then he told her that the color green isn’t used on stage, because it’s considered bad luck. (In earlier times, toxic compounds in the green dye would sometimes make the actors sick and die.) \n \n“Performers will give their souls to each performance,” says Prager. “Then they might look out at the audience and see someone’s falling asleep. To some people it’s just another night and then they’ll go home and carry on with their lives. And for the performer I think it’s much more than that. If they’re really giving a good performance, it can be a moment in between life and death.” \n \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/5429af9471ac6d00725e87d4]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

      "body":"Our collectible-craved ancestors traveled thousands of miles to see relics of supposed body parts of the saints, so I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that there’s a rabid market out there for Titanic artifacts. *But how did they stay dry?,* you might ask. Well in the case of the last lunch menu served aboard, it was packed by passenger Abraham Lincoln Salomon (that name, right?), a stationer who thought it would be a good souvenir to bring along on Lifeboat No. 1. Remember Lifeboat No. 1? That’s the one that carried 12 mostly male passengers, in a boat fit for 40, after the captain announced women and children first, also known as the “money boat.” \n\n\nThe lunch menu, as well as two other artifacts from the Titanic, will be a part of [an auction by Lion Heart Autographs](http://www.ebay.com/clt/collectibles-live-events/titanic-artifacts-from-survivors-of-infamous-lifeboat-no-1-and-rare-historic-autographs-in-all-fields-no-buyer-s-premium-571400) available on the eBay Live Auction Platform, that kicks off at noon E.S.T. on September 30, along with a huge trove of other letters and papers attached to famous figures, including Margaret Mitchell’s letter to a fan turning down her suggestion of writing a sequel to *Gone with the Wind* and a sad note from a completely broke F. Scott Fitzgerald. But because we like things grouped in fives around here, we scoured eBay for two more Titanic artifacts, and here you have them. Happy bidding!\n\n[Related: 5 Banksys Anyone Can Own](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/05/banksy-gilt-home)\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5601870e873a015e454b14d4]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n[__A menu from the last luncheon served aboard the Titanic__](http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/extremely-rare-menu-from-the-last-lunch-served-ab-103-c-9b34140a20)\n\n\nA pleasant reminder never to board a lifeboat fit for 40 on an empty stomach with 11 friends, this lunch menu will look great framed in your kitchen, where you spend so much time grilling mutton chops and fillets of brill. Or a great gift for the person in Lifeboat No. 1 of your life. \n\nYours for a mere $50,000 to $70,000. \n    \n\n\n[#image: /photos/560186f0ac079fd23782b02d]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n[__October 1912 letter, on Plaza Hotel stationary, written by Lifeboat No. 1 passenger Laura Mabel Francatelli to fellow passenger Abraham Lincoln Salomon about the “terrible experience”__](http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/oct.-1912-letter-from-a-titanic-survivor-about-th-102-c-3cd4e8e832)\n\n\nThere was a big brouhaha when the public found out about that whole 12-people-in-a-big-ass-lifeboat situation, leading to this letter between Salomon and another passenger on LB1, Laura Mabel. Cheaper than the fancy-pants menu (being only slightly touched by Titanic hands), it’s still a decent prize, especially for whiners. Stick it on your fridge for $4,000 to $6,000. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/560186f0ac079fd23782b02a]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n[__One of only four known tickets from Titanic’s Turkish baths’ weighing chair, custom-made by Henry Pooley & Son for Titanic’s Turkish baths’ cooling room__](http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/1-of-only-4-known-tickets-from-the-titanic-s-turk-104-c-9214bbbbe5)\n\nThis was no Disney cruise, it was the Titanic—and there was a full-on Turkish bath on the boat (for the first-class passengers only), where a person could sweat away the stresses of carrying all that money weight around and then check in afterward to see how many pounds they lost. This one was used by Salomon to take notes, as it includes the names of the other passengers on Lifeboat No. 1 with him. There are only four known tickets from the weighing chair in existence, so don’t let this one pass you by, for just $7,500 to $10,000!\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5601870fac079fd23782b050]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n[__Possible piece of fabric (not a part of the Lion Heart auction)__](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Titanic-Baize-Fabric-Artifact-Fragment-from-Smoking-Room-/331651087044?hash=item4d37f1fac4)\n\nWhat we have here, ladies and gentleman, is a piece of green fabric *possibly* from the smoking room of the Titanic. But even the ye olde letter from 1998 it’s so professionally attached to seems to be uncertain. Take your chances, for just $399. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/560186f0873a015e454b14cf]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n[__Possible piece of wood from grand staircase (not a part of the Lion Heart auction)__](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Titanic-Authentic-Aft-Grand-Staircase-Wreck-Wood-Rare-museum-artifact-/161820085403?hash=item25ad3a8c9b)\n\n\neBay is telling me that this piece of wood is viewed once per hour—that’s a lot of demand for a triangle of wood with a three-inch hypotenuse (do NOT be fooled by claims of Titanic wood cut into rectangles, warns the lister). It is *believed* to have come from the ship’s grand staircase (cue Celine Dion), which explains the dramatic price tag of $7,200. Too high? A nice gentleman named Kevin Saucier at TitanicItems.com sells pieces of Titanic wood for just $86 a shingle. “Perfect for the collector on a budget.” You can’t make this stuff up—oh wait. \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/54cb0236b624d691057715ee]||||||\n\n\n",

      "body":"In October of 1975, New York City went bust. After years of mismanagement and overspending the greatest city in the world needed $477 million that month to meet its debt obligations. But it only had $34 million on hand. Mayor Abe Beame was minutes from declaring the city in default. And Hugh Carey, the governor, cabled President Gerald Ford for immediate assistance. The president’s response? FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD was how the New York *Daily News* famously put it.\n\nThe situation was bleak, and it would take New York more than a decade to recover. Yet amid the chaos of insolvency, the town had one thing going for it—Broadway. In 1975, Broadway, after years of dark theaters and cultural irrelevancy, was beginning to stir. A musical called *A Chorus Line* opened that year and brought a dose of glamour to a decaying, crime-ridden, smut-filled Times Square. Every night, 1,500 theatergoers braved drug dealers, prostitutes, and pickpockets to see a show about the “gypsies” who danced in the chorus of a Broadway musical.\n\nThe opening of *A Chorus Line* at the Shubert Theatre that July revitalized not only Broadway but also the Shubert theatrical empire, which itself had almost gone under. Now the Shuberts were minting money with a production that would eventually run for 15 years—a record at the time. *A Chorus Line* also made its creator, Michael Bennett, the richest and most sought-after director in the world. Bennett, aged 32, followed up that show with a musical called *Ballroom.* It was a flop, and a bruising experience for Bennett. But after a short and frustrating stint in Hollywood, he headed back East to look for a new show to direct. At the same time, one of his closest friends, Tommy Tune—the lanky six-foot-six-inch dancer, choreographer, and up-and-coming director—was making his mark as a theatrical force. The men had been friends since 1965, when they’d met in the elevator of the Variety Arts rehearsal studios, on West 46th Street.\n\nTune, though four years older than Bennett, was in awe of him and considered him his mentor. But in the early 80s their friendship began to turn into a bitter rivalry, with repercussions for everyone on Broadway. And their clash—pitting Bennett’s *Dreamgirls* against Tune’s *Nine*—would eventually lead to what many consider the greatest face-off in the history of the Tony Awards.\n\n“I Want to Direct Your Show”\n----------------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nHoping to revitalize his standing on Broadway after his *Ballroom* drubbing, Michael Bennett shed many of his impresario trappings in the early 80s. Out went the fur coat he used to wear to opening nights, replaced by jeans, a T-shirt, and a baseball cap. Out went his chauffeur-driven Rolls, replaced by a van with a high-tech sound system. Out went Bennett’s wife, Donna McKechnie, his Tony-winning leading lady in *A Chorus Line.* (Bennett, despite his love for her, was gay, and their marriage lasted only a few months. They would remain friends, though estranged for long periods.)\n\nBennett continued his prodigious vodka intake as well as his drug use, favoring pot, quaaludes, and cocaine. Coke increased his already heightened paranoia and mood swings. But he was certain of one thing: if he was serious about getting back on track, he had to have a hit show, and quickly.\n\nIt just so happened that Tom Eyen, a writer and director, and Henry Krieger, a composer, were developing a musical they’d dreamed up over a lunch at a Greenwich Village coffee shop. It centered on three black singers from Chicago, the Dreamettes, who go to Harlem to compete on Amateur Night at the Apollo. Eyen’s working title was *One Night Only.* He scribbled a lyric on a napkin. Krieger sketched out a melody. Hoping to get some Broadway muscle behind the show, they auditioned 10 songs for Bennett and his producing partner, choreographer Bob Avian. The pair liked what they heard and gave them rehearsal space, with the understanding that Eyen would direct and, if the show turned out to be any good, Bennett and Avian would come on as producers.\n\nEyen and Krieger cast Jennifer Holliday as Effie—the overweight lead singer of the Dreamettes. Holliday had impressed them in *Your Arms Too Short to Box with God.* And when she arrived for her audition she had big rouge circles on her cheeks, reminding Krieger of Pagliacci. After their second workshop, Bennett surprised Eyen and Krieger, telling them, “I’m going to make you rich. I want to direct your show.” Eyen was hurt, but this was the great Michael Bennett, so he relented.\n\nThe production—now called *Dreamgirls*—went into high gear. Eyen had played ping-pong with the actors, taking their ideas and refining them. That was not Bennett’s way. The musical unfolded in his mind and he dictated it to the cast. He wanted it to move like a movie—swiftly, and barely pausing for the audience to catch its breath. And with its tale of show-business success and excess, friendship and betrayal, he wanted theatergoers to feel its brutality. Rehearsals could be hair-raising. In a key scene, Effie walks into her dressing room and comes face-to-face with her replacement. “Who is she?,” Effie demands. Sheryl Lee Ralph, as Deena, was not responding to the dramatic situation to Bennett’s satisfaction. Bennett erupted, “Get the fuck out of rehearsals! Get out of the room! You have no fucking feelings! Get out of my life!” Ralph burst into tears. Bennett went over to her, put his arm around her, and said, “That’s what I want, honey. And I want it every night.”\n\nA turning point came when Bennett prodded Eyen and Krieger to come up with a strong first-act ending. Eyen dashed off a lyric; Krieger went over to a piano in a small studio. Krieger diddled around for an hour but came up cold. He thought the phrase “And I am telling you I’m not goin’ ” was awkward. “There was a knock at the door,” Krieger recalled, “and it was Ray Stark, the producer. He was working on the early stages of the movie *Annie* [down the hall]. He said he was sorry to bother me, but he needed to use the phone. He made his phone call, thanked me, [and left].” The interlude proved to be the perfect change of pace. “I went back to work. At which point the song wrote itself.” Krieger returned to the rehearsal room to try out his handiwork on Eyen, Bennett, and Avian. He taught Holliday the number while she was performing it, the two of them singing back and forth. It brought down the house at the impromptu run-through—with Bennett leading the applause.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55fc642baccf6caa52fb68b5]|||\nHolliday and Bennett at the show’s opening-night after-party, December 1981\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n“A Seismic Jolt”\n----------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe producer of *Dreamgirls* was the Shubert Organization, led by theatrical titans Gerald Schoenfeld and Bernard Jacobs, who was a father figure to Bennett. Their partner in the show was David Geffen, at the time one of the giants in the music business—and a close friend of Bennett’s. Yet, for all its promise, *Dreamgirls* was unsteady as it headed into rehearsals in Boston in October 1981. Eyen, resentful he’d been muscled aside as director, fought Bennett over changes to the script. Bennett was issuing his usual demands for better scenes and songs, but Eyen resisted, insisting, “I’m the writer, not him!”\n\nOften paranoid, Bennett—the son of an inveterate gambler from Buffalo who for years had been in hock to local mobsters—was convinced that the Mafia was out to get a cut of his success. Eyen, meanwhile, “was a wild, hotheaded Arab-American. He gave Michael the hives, literally,” said Krieger. “They were both explosive types.” When Eyen saw the original poster for the show—which read, MICHAEL BENNETT’S *DREAMGIRLS*—he went berserk. “He thought it suggested Michael had written it,” said John Breglio, Bennett’s lawyer, “so we changed it to ‘Michael Bennett’s Production of *Dreamgirls*’—which was a huge concession, considering Michael’s stature.”\n\nThere also had been tension between Bennett and Holliday. At one point, he fired her because she wasn’t acting the role to his satisfaction. But when he realized he couldn’t find anyone who sang “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” as powerfully as she did, he took her to see Lena Horne in *The Lady and Her Music,* then the hottest show on Broadway. He bought Holliday dinner and rehired her. And then she fell in love with him. He helped her buy a condominium. Some in the company believed they were sleeping together, but Krieger knew better. She was large—*and* a woman.\n\nDespite the strains, *Dreamgirls,* with its fluid, rapid staging, began to feel like a hit, drawing early upbeat reviews in Boston. Soon, Broadway was humming with the news that Michael Bennett had another winner. Ticket sales started to take off.\n\n*Dreamgirls* opened at New York’s Imperial Theatre on December 20, 1981. The first-night audience stood and cheered after “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” then stood and cheered again at the curtain. At the opening-night party, Bennett worried about the reviews. He knocked back vodka to calm his nerves. All that really mattered, in the end, was the endorsement of *The New York Times.* At 9:45 P.M., someone handed him a copy of Frank Rich’s review. “When Broadway history is being made, you can feel it,” Rich wrote. “What you feel is a seismic emotional jolt that sends the audience, as one, right out of its wits. While such moments are uncommonly rare these days, I’m here to report that one popped up at the Imperial last night. Broadway history was made at the end of the first act of Michael Bennett’s beautiful and heartbreaking new musical, ‘Dreamgirls.’ ” Rich then described, in detail, Holliday’s performance, before concluding, “Mr. Bennett has long been [Jerome] Robbins’s Broadway heir apparent, as he had demonstrated in two previous ‘Gypsy’-like backstage musicals, ‘Follies’ and ‘A Chorus Line.’ But last night the torch was passed, firmly, unquestionably, once and for all.”\n\n\n\nBennett was back with a vengeance, and *Dreamgirls* looked poised to sweep the Tonys. But there were clouds on the horizon. The mighty Shubert Organization—its coffers swelling from hits such as *A Chorus Line* and, now, *Dreamgirls*—was “starting to be seen as the Evil Empire,” as Breglio put it. Moreover, Schoenfeld and Jacobs were maneuvering—against popular sentiment in the theater community—to have the Morosco Theatre torn down to accommodate the Marriott Marquis, a hotel perfectly situated for funneling out-of-towners to Shubert shows. By March, both the Morosco and the cherished Helen Hayes Theatre would fall to the wrecking ball—to the dismay of scores of actors and directors who were arrested in unsuccessful protests to save the performance spaces. And now many on Broadway were looking to get back at the Evil Empire.\n\nTale of the Tape\n----------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nTommy Tune was probably the only person in the theater world not preoccupied with the fight to spare the doomed Times Square landmarks. Tune had a show to put on.\n\nThe show: an adaptation of Federico Fellini’s classic film *8 1/2,* about an Italian movie director on the verge of a nervous breakdown. It had come to Tune’s attention in the form of a cassette tape pushed through his mail slot. He was living on West 55th Street, in Michael Bennett’s old apartment, when he found the tape and a handwritten note: “I’m your upstairs neighbor, and I’m working on my musical version of *8 1/2*. I call it *Nine.*”\n\nThe package had been dropped off by Mario Fratti, who was writing the script. The score was by Maury Yeston, a Yale music professor. Tune threw the cassette into his weekend bag and headed out to Fire Island. The next morning he went for a walk on the beach, put on his Walkman headphones, and listened. The first thing he heard was the sweeping, gorgeous “Overture Delle Donne,” played on the piano. Tune envisioned a bathhouse in an elegant European spa—somewhere in Italy. He’d been looking for a show to direct. He had found it. “I had to do it,” he recalled.\n\nTo produce *Nine,* Tune turned to his boyfriend, Michel Stuart, one of the original cast members of *A Chorus Line.* Thommie Walsh was conscripted to assist with the choreography. Writer Arthur Kopit was brought in to rework Fratti’s script. Kopit was represented by ICM, headed by the brash and formidable agent Sam Cohn, who persuaded Paramount Pictures to put up $150,000 for a workshop.\n\nIn addition to Stuart’s producing responsibilities, he would design the costumes. Walsh thought Stuart needed an assistant and suggested a friend, William Ivey Long, a young master’s graduate from the Yale School of Drama. But Long turned down the job “with tears in my eyes,” as he recalled, “because I didn’t want to be anybody’s assistant.” A few weeks later, however, he received a phone call. “Can you measure all the girls today, and also do a shoe tracing?” the caller wanted to know.\n\n“Excuse me?,” Long asked. “What show is this?”\n\n“This is for *Nine* the musical,” said the caller, who identified himself as the stage manager. “We’re rehearsing on top of the New Amsterdam Theatre. You’re the costume designer.”\n\n*Nine* was being thrown together like a high-school play.\n\n\n“A ‘Fuck You’ to *Dreamgirls*”\n------------------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe New Amsterdam Theatre, an Art Nouveau palace that was once the home of the storied Ziegfeld *Follies,* had been in disrepair for years. The roof garden, where rehearsals were held, had holes in the walls and ceilings, and snow would occasionally flutter in. On certain days, the actors performed in winter coats.\n\nThe first thing William Ivey Long saw when he arrived there were several women sitting on the stage—a tall, angular Karen Akers; a buxom Anita Morris, distinguished by her fiery red tresses; a raven-haired beauty named Shelly Burch; and Liliane Montevecchi, a rail-thin and temperamental performer who had danced in the Folies Bergère. The only man in the cast was the rising star Raul Julia.\n\nInitial drafts of *Nine* had several male characters (as there are in the 2009 movie), but Tune hit on a daring idea. The show was about Guido Contini and all the women in his life—his mother, his wife, his lovers, his producer, the whore who seduced him as a boy. There would be four boys playing young Guido and his friends, but Raul Julia would be the only adult male in the cast. He would be surrounded by 21 women.\n\n\n+++large\n\n[#image: /photos/55fc642caccf6caa52fb68c1]|||\nA high-spirited Tune in front of a poster for Bennett’s *A Chorus Line,* 1980.\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nLong was immediately put off by Tune and his team. “I thought they were preposterous and pretentious,” he said. “They held hands and talked about Karma, and Michel Stuart carried around a bag of crystals that, he said, had magic powers. Somebody would blow up a balloon before rehearsals, and they’d pass it around because it contained the ‘soul’ of the show. Really? Tommy had his head in the clouds, but of course he is taller than everybody else. I definitely had no idea what was going on.” Long continued to be baffled during rehearsals. Yeston, a bundle of energy, would write songs to order. Beautiful, elegant melodies poured out of him; if you needed one song, he’d give you three—take your pick. But the script was all over the place, and there was barely a second act.\n\nLong spent weeks researching Italian fashion designers. Post-rehearsal production meetings were usually held at Charlies’, a pub on West 45th Street. The creators were putting *Nine* together over beer and hamburgers. Long would often explain his ideas for costumes: the actresses, for most of the show, would wear black, which would look striking against the white tiles of the spa. But several weeks into rehearsals, he still hadn’t drawn anything. Then one night his assistant said, “We’re not leaving here until you draw every single black dress you’ve been talking about.” The napkins at Charlies’ were long and thin, perfect for illustrating costumes for the tall women Tune had cast. By three in the morning, Long had sketched more than 30 outfits on the napkins.\n\nIn February 1982, Tune staged a workshop for the show’s backers, including Barry Diller, who was running Paramount. A few days later, Paramount gave word that it was dropping out of the project. As Tune recalled and *The New York Times* reported, Diller didn’t think Raul Julia was a big enough star to carry the show.\n\nWithout Paramount’s backing, rehearsals were suspended, and Michel Stuart and another producer, Harvey Klaris, along with Sam Cohn, scrambled to find new funding. The Shuberts passed. But along came willing partners, among them two young producers—Francine LeFrak, the real-estate scion, and garment-business tycoon Kenneth Greenblatt—as well as James M. Nederlander, a Shubert rival, who owned several Broadway theaters. He offered one of his best, the 46th Street, which shared a back wall with the Imperial, where *Dreamgirls* was playing to sold-out houses. *Nine* was back on.\n\nThere was no money, however, for an out-of-town tryout. So the show would have to open cold on Broadway. The cutoff date for Tony Award eligibility was May 9. Judy Jacksina, the show’s press agent, had an idea: why not open *Nine* on the ninth? She knew the show had to make an eleventh-hour splash in a field dominated by *Dreamgirls.*\n\nJacksina had other stunts up her sleeve. Her greatest weapons were the show’s 21 striking women. Why not cover the front of the theater with life-size photos of them in their black costumes? “I wanted to seductively represent what was going on inside the theater,” she said. “I didn’t want cute little tap-dancing photos. I wanted sex.” There was one hitch, though. The costumes had yet to be made. All that existed were Long’s sketches on the napkins. “I had to make 27 costumes in two weeks,” Long recalled. “I’ve never worked under such pressure in my entire career.” Long brought two dozen dresses to the photo shoot, which lasted 23 hours. Two days later, at 7:30 A.M., workmen started covering the theater’s façade with huge blowups of the women. By 11, traffic was tied up on 46th Street. Drivers were stopping to gawk. Local news crews descended on the scene. *Nine* had yet to play a performance and already it was news. “You know what those photographs were?,” Long said. “They were a ‘Fuck you!’ to *Dreamgirls.*”\n\nA few nights later, Tune, exhausted from a marathon rehearsal, was about to climb into bed when the phone rang. “Darling!,” Michael Bennett said. “You have to go out of town with your show. That’s what we do!”\n\n“I know. But, Michael, we don’t have any money. We can’t afford to go out of town,” Tune replied.\n\n“But, darling, you must go out of town,” Bennett insisted. “You will go out of town, and I will help you, and you’ll come in in the fall.”\n\n“It’s not possible, Michael,” Tune said. “We have no money. We have to open now.”\n\n“You will go out of town—do you hear me?,” Bennett hissed. “You will go out of town.”\n\nBennett’s tone frightened Tune. Years later he would remember it as “black, the Devil—it was Mafia-like. He had become the thing he feared.”\n\nTune hung up the phone and stood in his kitchen, shaking.\n\nA Canal, a Catsuit—and Bird Poop\n--------------------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nAs the wrecking crane’s claw tore into the Helen Hayes that March, Tommy Tune was racing to finish *Nine* next door. Previews were to begin April 22, and the second act was still a shambles. There were “12 different endings,” Jacksina said, as well as an interminable homage to rococo opéra bouffe—“The Grand Canal”—in the middle of the second act. “Oh God,” Jacksina said, “it was longer than *Aida*!”\n\nThere were other hurdles. During an advertising meeting, one of the producers announced he had to go to Rome—two weeks before previews were set to start. “Why are you going to Rome?,” Jacksina asked.\n\n“I have to go talk to Mr. Fellini,” the producer responded. “We don’t have the rights.” (He would return a few days later with the blessings of the director and of *8 1/2* producer Angelo Rizzoli.)\n\nThe race was on to haul *Nine* across the May 9 finish line. Long was still completing the costumes. Tune wanted doves released over the audience during the final scene. (The first time the birds were let loose in rehearsal they relieved themselves on actress Taina Elg’s white hat.) The painting of the set was completed an hour or so before the curtain rose.\n\nThat first preview was rocky. There was no intermission, and some baffled audience members walked out in the middle. Those who remained could hear the roar that went up next door at the Imperial when Jennifer Holliday sang “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going.” A similar exodus occurred on day two, causing Jacksina to demand of Tune, “If you don’t put an intermission in this show, I am going to die. Do you hear me?”\n\nAn intermission went in the next day. Then Tune began to cut, mercilessly. Out went most of “The Grand Canal,” and with it many of Long’s costumes. The ending still wasn’t working. One night writer Arthur Kopit said, “Let’s cut the finale”—in which the cast wore white. “Nobody understands it. It looks like they’re all getting married.” Long had had enough. “Fuck you, Arthur!” he screamed. “It’s about rebirth. It’s about hope!” Tune, who never lost his temper amid the chaos, listened impassively. Then he said, “The finale stays.”\n\nDespite its problems, *Nine* was generating strong word of mouth. People were struck by Tune’s elegant cinematic staging, Yeston’s gorgeous melodies, and Anita Morris, wearing a provocative black lace catsuit. There was great buzz on the evening of May 8 when the critics came to review the show the day before the premiere.\n\nThe night *Nine* opened, Michael Bennett threw a party at his Central Park South penthouse for a few close friends. And at precisely 11:20 he turned on the local news to see what the critics had to say about his protégé’s musical. “*Nine* is an extraordinary show,” said Dennis Cunningham on the local CBS affiliate. “A show to treasure. Tommy Tune has done masterful work. A startling act of imagination, independence, and daring, *Nine*—”\n\n*Smash!* The television screen shattered. Bennett had hurled a tumbler of vodka at Dennis Cunningham. The room fell silent. Then Bennett went to the kitchen and returned with two bottles of Cristal. He poured out champagne for everyone and said, “I want to toast my friend Tommy Tune tonight on his success. Here’s to Tommy. And here’s to *Nine.*”\n\nAt the opening-night party, the cast and crew of *Nine* nervously awaited the reviews. The Associated Press was out, and it was excellent. They’d heard through the grapevine that Clive Barnes, in the *New York Post,* was also a rave. But it was the *Times*—it was Frank Rich—that counted. Jacksina came into the party with an early edition and handed it to Francine LeFrak.\n\n“There are two unquestionable reasons to cheer *Nine,* the extravagantly uneven musical that opened at the 46th Street [Theatre] last night,” Rich wrote. “Their names are Tommy Tune and Maury Yeston.” He praised Tune as “a man who could create rainbows in a desert,” and said Yeston had written some of the season’s “most novel and beautiful songs.” LeFrak’s heart sank, however, when she read on. “For all the brilliantly styled moments in *Nine,* there are others where stylization curdles into the vulgarity of kitsch and camp.” Rich complained that, at its center, the show was hollow, that its creators never made the audience care about Guido or the women “who gnaw at his soul.” And then came the punch. “For all his musical inspiration, Mr. Yeston can write pedestrian lyrics.”\n\nThat night it appeared that *Nine* might sag under the weight of mixed reviews. But none of that mattered by the next afternoon. As the Tony nominations were announced, *Nine* received 12—including a nod for best musical—just one shy of *Dreamgirls’* take. The battle was on.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55fc642daccf6caa52fb68c5]|||\nAnita Morris, as Carla, shows off William Ivey Long’s black lace catsuit\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nTug-of-War for a Tony\n---------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nJon Wilner, an ad executive who worked on *Nine,* said the war between the shows “affected everyone in and around the industry. I am not making a joke here, but if the Shuberts went to this deli, then the *Nine* people wouldn’t go to that deli. That’s how bad it was.” Behind the scenes, the campaign was being fought by the generals—the Shuberts’ Bernie Jacobs, for *Dreamgirls,* and Sam Cohn, for *Nine.* The battle turned ugly. Gossip spread that the Shuberts had offered Cohn $1 million to delay the opening of *Nine* until the fall. Another rumor had it that the Shuberts lobbied Con Edison to withhold the extra power allotment that the 46th Street Theatre needed to operate the sets for *Nine.* Jacobs was convinced Cohn was fanning the rumors to make the Shuberts look like bullies. Cohn denied the charge. Jacobs, meanwhile, bad-mouthed *Nine,* phoning many of the nearly 700 Tony voters and laying on the pressure—even though they would cast their ballots anonymously. “He made it clear,” one voter recalled years later. “If you wanted to do business with the Shuberts, you’d better vote for *Dreamgirls.*”\n\n“The producers of *Nine* knew as much about producing a Broadway show as I know how to do plumbing,” said Wilner. “They could only have advertising meetings when there was a nine—it had to be on the 9th, the 19th, or the 29th of the month. Sam Cohn’s name wasn’t on anything, but he was calling the shots.” Cohn would read the memos—and then, as was his habit, eat them. (Cohn’s paper-eating tic was legendary around Broadway. Once, after breakfast with Bernie Jacobs and Philip J. Smith—who would become the Shubert chairman—Cohn reached for the check. “Where is it?” he said. “You ate it, Sam,” Smith replied.)\n\nThe producers of *Nine* were worried. How in the world, they wondered, could a musical created in slapdash fashion, saddled with mixed reviews, and caught in the crosshairs of the Shuberts ever dream of toppling *Dreamgirls*?\n\n“And the Winner Is …”\n---------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe 36th Annual Tony Awards took place on June 6, 1982, at the Imperial Theatre, home to *Dreamgirls.* The atmosphere was tense. Alex Cohen, the wily producer of the telecast, ratcheted up the angst by seating the *Dreamgirls* camp on the right side of the theater and the *Nine* camp on the left. It was the Jets versus the Sharks.\n\nThe design awards came first, presented prior to the live broadcast on CBS. When Tharon Musser won for best lighting design, for *Dreamgirls,* the right side of the house screamed and applauded. Next up was best costume design, which went to *Nine’*s William Ivey Long. Then it was Yeston’s turn; he won for best score, for *Nine.* Before the actual telecast began, the final honoree was Tom Eyen, for his book to *Dreamgirls.* The tally: *Dreamgirls,* two; *Nine,* two.\n\nCBS opened its show with a shot of Times Square and the theme from the popular “I Love New York” campaign, then in its fifth year. Had the audience in the Imperial Theatre that night not been so focused on the battle between *Dreamgirls* and *Nine,* perhaps they would have recognized that their once dying industry and their once dying city were making a comeback. But they didn’t care. “All we thought about was who’s going to win,” said Judy Jacksina.\n\nEarly in the evening, Milton Berle walked out onstage. “It’s a pleasure … to find myself reading the nominees for outstanding director of a musical. And they are: Michael Bennett, for *Dreamgirls.*” There was a quick cut to Bennett, his shiny black eyes wide open, his hands clasped.\n\nBerle continued: “Martin Charnin, for *The First,* Tony Tanner, for *Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,* and Tommy Tune, for *Nine.*” The camera turned to Tune, beaming and eager. “And the winner is … ”\n\nSomeone in the audience shouted, “*Dreamgirls*!”\n\nBerle said, “*Dreamgirls.* Big mouth! *Dreamgirls.* And the winner is … ” He looked up and said, “*Nine*! Tommy Tune, Tommy Tune, Tommy Tune!”\n\nThe left side of the house erupted in shrieks and cheers.\n\nTune tap-danced across the stage and said, “Well, this is just great! … Thank you. I have to do a gesture because words aren’t enough.” He put his Tony down, placed his hands on his heart, and then threw open his arms. “All right, I’m going home,” he said. “Bye!” And then he twirled his way into the wings.\n\nSoon came the honors for choreography. Ben Vereen opened the envelope and said, “Michael Bennett and Michael Peters! Yeah!” for *Dreamgirls*. The pair bolted down the aisle. Bennett, holding his Tony aloft, looked relieved and exclaimed, “We’re very happy to be up here!” *Dreamgirls* picked up the next award, too, for lead actor: Ben Harney (for his role as an unscrupulous talent manager), beating out Raul Julia.\n\nThat night, the showstopping musical interlude belonged to Jennifer Holliday, who mesmerized the audience with “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going.” Her performance was so electric that many viewers at home assumed that *Dreamgirls* had best musical in the bag. But the tide shifted again with the following award, for featured actress, which went to Liliane Montevecchi, from *Nine.* Next, the theater’s right side went wild when Cleavant Derricks (who played a James Brown-like figure in the show) collected his statuette for featured actor for *Dreamgirls.* Left and right it went, as pianist Victor Borge took the stage to present the Tony for lead actress. The winner? *Dreamgirls’* Jennifer Holliday.\n\nThe score: *Dreamgirls,* six; *Nine,* four. The final award of the night, for best musical, would be presented by Lena Horne.\n\nBackstage, during the commercial break, Horne said to one of the show’s organizers, “I hope they wrote the winner in big letters because I’m not going to put on my glasses on national TV.” The winner, she was told, was typed in small letters. “That’s not going to work,” she replied. One of the accountants who tallied the votes said he would open the envelope, write the winner in big letters, and put it in a fresh envelope. “Oh, never mind,” Horne said. “Honey, I know how to read the word ‘Dreamgirls.’ ”\n\nWith that, Horne strode in from the wings, resplendent in a flowing gown. “This is a pretty theater, isn’t it?” she said. “And it’s full of the sounds of all this gorgeous music.” She then read off the nominees for best musical. They were: *Dreamgirls, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Nine,* and *Pump Boys and Dinettes.*\n\nThere wasn’t a sound in the Imperial.\n\nHorne opened the envelope and said, “I hope they printed this big enough for me to read without my glasses. The winner is”—she looked up, surprised—“*Nine.*”\n\nThe left side of the theater was a scene of pandemonium. Tommy Tune and *Nine* had triumphed over Michael Bennett’s *Dreamgirls* and the almighty Shuberts.\n\nThe next morning, Shubert chairman Gerald Schoenfeld called Harvey Sabinson, the executive director of the League of New York Theatres and Producers, and demanded a recount. Sabinson had to stifle a laugh. The ballots, he told Schoenfeld, were destroyed by the accounting firm as soon as they were tallied, precisely to discourage such disgruntled phone calls.\n\n“Then we’ll sift through the ashes!,” Schoenfeld snarled.\n\n__Adapted from *Razzle Dazzle: The Battle for Broadway*, by Michael Riedel, to be published in October by Simon & Schuster, Inc.; © 2015 by the author.__ \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55fc671e3a02e0b16051cb8a]||||||\n\n\n",
