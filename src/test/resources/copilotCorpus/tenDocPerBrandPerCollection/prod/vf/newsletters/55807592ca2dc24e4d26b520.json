      "body":"**I. Wolf Pack**\n----------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nJess Cunningham was a staff sergeant in a mechanized unit of the U.S. Army—Alpha Company, First Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, First Infantry Division—during the intensified fighting that accompanied the surge of American troops in Baghdad in 2007. This was his second tour in Iraq, and his first with Alpha Company. He had been a high-school football star in Bakersfield, California, before heading off to war. He had excelled in the army, rising rapidly through the ranks. Now 26, he was strong, alert, and accustomed to battle. He had a bright future.\n\nBut he also had a problem. Although Alpha Company appeared from the outside to be like any other infantry unit, neatly integrated into the larger American force structure, on the inside it revolved to an unusual degree around a single personality—that of an imposing first sergeant, a hard-charging 18-year veteran named John Hatley, who dominated the company. Hatley was a burly Texan who spoke with a drawl. He carried his 240 pounds on a six-foot frame, and at the age of 40 still achieved a perfect 300 on the army’s physical-fitness test. He had been the company’s first sergeant for three years and had delayed a promotion to sergeant major in order to return with his men to the fight. He reveled in his power. He made it clear that the rules of engagement that mattered were the ones he alone defined. Cunningham had never encountered such a sergeant before. He himself was a team player and not immune to Hatley’s leadership qualities, but over the first few months in Baghdad he began to struggle privately with doubts. The company called itself Wolf Pack and sometimes seemed to act like one. Cunningham did not question the war itself, but he wondered about the treatment of Iraqi detainees and the actions of certain gunners who seemed to be playing loose with their justifications for killing.\n\nAlpha Company’s area of operations lay in southwest Baghdad, one of the most active battlefields in Iraq. Sunnis and Shiites were fighting over the neighborhoods, and insurgents from both groups were warring on American patrols. The U.S. mission was to promote stability. This boiled down to convoys of recent American high-school graduates lumbering around in Bradley troop carriers and armored Humvees from which they could barely see, struggling to distinguish combatants from civilians in an indecipherable city, and waiting to get attacked. Cunningham served as a squad leader in the company’s Second Platoon. They were based with Hatley’s headquarters platoon at a fortified combat outpost called Angry Dragon, which also housed the company’s Tactical Operations Center, an office and briefing room known as Wolf Den on the radios. Wolf Pack, Wolf Den, Angry Dragon—the bravura was probably useful, given the youth of the soldiers. The engagements were frequent and anything but child’s play. They resulted in uncounted numbers of Iraqi deaths. By contrast, the accounting of American losses was carefully done. During Alpha Company’s 14 months on the ground, six soldiers were killed and three were gravely wounded—a toll that amounted to a casualty rate of about 15 percent in Cunningham’s platoon alone. The first soldier died four months into the fight, on February 27, 2007. He was a tall, 22-year-old staff sergeant named Karl Soto-Pinedo, who was shot in the head by a sniper after he rose too high above the hatch of his Bradley. Three weeks later, on March 17, 2007, a 30-year-old specialist named Marieo Guerrero was lost to a jerry-rigged land mine, an I.E.D.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThen, in late March or early April, on a date lost as much to obfuscation as to the blur of war, Cunningham was given a training task, to serve as the leader of a routine “presence” patrol. The patrol consisted of a pair of lead and tail-end Bradleys, with three Humvees in between. Around noon they rolled out of the combat outpost carrying about 20 soldiers and multiple top-mounted guns. Cunningham occupied the first Humvee, along with a crew that included the unit’s civilian interpreter, an Iraqi called “Dennis.” The second Humvee was the one that mattered. It belonged to Hatley, who had decided to attach himself to the patrol to evaluate Cunningham’s performance. Along with his regular driver and gunner, Hatley was accompanied by the two men closest to him—the company’s chief medic, Sergeant Michael “Doc” Leahy, 27, who rode with Hatley wherever he went, and the Second Platoon’s senior NCO, Sergeant First Class Joseph Mayo, 26, a careerist whose eagerness to impress Hatley seemed to know no bounds. In the privacy of Alpha Company at war, these three men—Hatley flanked by Leahy and Mayo—formed the unit’s triumvirate of power.\n\n\n+++large\n\n[#image: /photos/557f1d32320a56cf4241131b]|||\nCunningham and Michael “Doc” Leahy at Camp Slayer, in Baghdad.\n|||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir presence on the patrol frustrated Cunningham’s authority from the start but did not lessen his formal responsibility for the mission. The patrol rolled west. The patrol rolled south. It rolled into a neighborhood where Cunningham got out with the interpreter and asked about life on the ground. People said times were tough, and the patrol rolled on. Two hours after leaving the combat outpost, the patrol came under small-arms fire. The vehicles had stopped on an empty street between shuttered houses. The rounds clanged against the armor and caused the top gunners to hunker down. Hatley radioed to Cunningham, “What’ve you got?” Cunningham suspected he had the usual—angry locals who could melt away at will. He did not get excited. He radioed, “Does anyone have anything? All White elements respond. Direction? Distance?” The gunner on the tail-end Bradley spotted the gunfire coming from a rooftop in a cluster of buildings to the south. He answered with a burst of his own. The shooting stopped. Cunningham ordered a move toward the position. With some difficulty the convoy turned around, but it was blocked by marshy land and had to detour to the east before navigating back to the vicinity from which the attack had come. By then the attackers had gone.\n\nThe soldiers continued with the patrol, working westward through a succession of neighborhoods with guns at the ready, spoiling for a fight. Word of the earlier engagement must have gotten around, because the streets were deserted. Then, after more than an hour and a mile, the patrol came upon an Arab man in the street. The encounter did not occur in the heat of battle. It had no obvious connection to the confrontation earlier that day, and was in a different part of town. The man was alone. He may or may not have been a fighter. He could have just stood there, waved in a friendly manner, or held up his hands to demonstrate that he was unarmed. He could have shouted, “Mister, I love America!” Four years into the occupation, he probably knew that much English. But he was stupid. Startled by the patrol, he dashed across the street and disappeared into a doorway.\n\nDon’t run if you want to look innocent. The convoy splayed into defensive positions, and soldiers sprang out. Hatley, Leahy, and Mayo were the first to go through the doorway, followed by Cunningham and others. On the inside they found a group of frightened women and children and five men of military age with their hands raised in submission, saying, “No, mister.” It was an ugly scene: the women were babbling and pleading in Arabic, a language known to some of the soldiers as “their native tongue.” The men were positioned facing the wall, professing their innocence. None was armed. A quick search turned up a single Kalashnikov assault rifle with two loaded magazines—the standard household allowance in Iraq. Unconvinced, the Americans began a more thorough search, lifting the carpets, pulling a refrigerator from the wall, shifting furniture, opening drawers and containers and spilling the contents onto the floors. They called this “flipping” the place. Eventually they discovered a green bag containing a bulletproof vest, a cell phone, some electrical wire, and belts of 7.62-mm. ammunition. Then, a few doors down the street, in an otherwise empty shop, they found the matching weapons—several machine guns.\n\nThe captured men denied any knowledge of the weapons, but it seemed obvious that they were lying. Whether all or any of them were insurgents was a more difficult question, particularly in a neighborhood riven by sectarian violence, but Hatley and his soldiers—including Cunningham—assumed that they were. The women pleaded for mercy in their native tongue. The men were flex-cuffed with their hands behind their backs, and were blindfolded with ACE bandages. At about that time Cunningham thought he heard Hatley saying to Mayo, “How do you feel about offing these guys?” Cunningham was not sure he had heard correctly. He was standing beside another sergeant, Charles Quigley, a quiet but articulate soldier from Rhode Island. Hatley and Mayo walked up. According to Cunningham, Mayo said, “You guys have an issue if we take these guys out?”\n\nCunningham said, “What?”\n\n“Offing them. Killing them. It’ll prevent us from seeing them again.”\n\nCunningham said, “No, man. I’m not going to do that.” Quigley also declined.\n\nMayo peered at them with disdain. Hatley said, “No one’s forcing you. I’ll do it myself.” He turned and walked away. Cunningham and Quigley exchanged looks. Hatley and Mayo began surveying the other soldiers, pulling them aside one by one; Cunningham doubted whether any of them would dare to refuse. He decided to put a stop to it. He ambled over to his Humvee and quietly asked the driver to call in a formal situation report to company headquarters—to include their location, the weapons seized, and especially the fact that they had taken prisoners. The report would be entered into the company log, and this might calm things down. Cunningham returned to Quigley’s side as if nothing had happened. A few minutes later, company headquarters radioed back, asking for an exact count of the detainees and an expected time of arrival at the combat outpost. The man who took that call was Hatley’s driver.\n\nHatley angrily demanded to know who had called in the report. When he got the answer, Cunningham says, he and Mayo stormed over in a rage. Mayo shouted at Cunningham, “What the fuck are you doing? You can’t fucking control your soldiers? Why’d you call up a sitrep? You fucking pussy! You piece of fucking shit!” Cunningham looked at him. He had never been good at verbalizing his thinking. That does not mean that he was not good at thinking. He thought, You’re supposed to be my platoon sergeant. You’re supposed to be the one shutting Hatley down. Why am I doing it? But Cunningham said none of what he thought. He stood there silently and, in army tradition, sucked up the abuse.\n\n\n[#video: //player.cnevids.com/embed/5553774061646d17a3000000/51cc9f86bb8f554e4e000002](640x447)||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rear ramp of the lead Bradley dropped down, and the five detainees, blindfolded and bound, were led into the troop compartment. The Bradley was commanded by a sergeant named Daniel Evoy. It had a driver and gunner as well, but otherwise was empty. The detainees were seated face-to-face on steel benches. Mayo assigned the job of guarding them to a private named Joshua Hartson, who was a newcomer and the lowest in the hierarchy of the patrol. He gave Hartson a nine-mm. Beretta pistol and said, “It’s your word against anyone else’s if something were to happen.” The message was clear, but Hartson was not the type to shoot these men. He sat in the back with them as the rear ramp clanged shut and the convoy set off through the streets.\n\n**II. Band of Brothers**\n------------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nBakersfield, California, is an uneasy city, a gang-infested boom-and-bust oil town where a fast-growing Hispanic population is overrunning an established country-and-western core. Jess Cunningham and a nearly identical twin brother were born anchored into the Anglo community, with two sets of grandparents who were next-door neighbors and a large number of uncles, aunts, cousins, and friends constituting a network of what is locally known as good families—those instilled with the traditional values of athletics, honest work, and love of home. Cunningham’s father is a Caterpillar mechanic and former rodeo rider. His mother is a medical-billing clerk and devout churchgoer. The two were divorced when he was young, but they participated equally in his upbringing and provided him with a happy childhood, full of team sports, outdoor activities, and moderate studies.\n\nIn October 1997, however, the dark side of California caught up with him. Cunningham was a junior in high school at the time. The star of his football team, a senior named Chad Yarbrough, who was the handsome scion of an outstanding family, was waylaid by two Mexican gang members after an argument at a party. They intercepted him after he had driven his girlfriend home, then forced him at gunpoint to take them to an orange grove, where they executed him with a shot to the head. One of the killers was soon arrested and subsequently sentenced to life in prison; the other was captured nine months later, and in 2001 was sentenced to death. His appeals continue, but, whatever his fate, he has been dealt with decisively—and good riddance. Yarbrough was 17 years old when he died. The horror of his murder marked Cunningham profoundly. He never mentioned the episode while in the army, but it was part of him every day in Iraq.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nCunningham graduated in 1999 and enrolled in Bakersfield College, where he played football for a year and flunked a course in American studies while earning an A in Mexican history, to the amusement of his friends. His horizons were near: he wanted to complete enough college to qualify for a civil-service job as a policeman, firefighter, or prison guard; he wanted a house and a family; and he wanted to stay in Bakersfield. He got a job as a maintenance man at an agricultural processing plant, and was there on the morning of September 11, 2001, when he watched the terrorist attacks unfold on television. Afterward he began to think about joining the fight—not in a patriotic rush but out of a growing curiosity about war. He had always liked John Wayne and had recently been impressed by the HBO series *Band of Brothers* and the movie *Black Hawk Down.* By the spring of 2002, with U.S. forces engaged in Afghanistan and the first reports of local boys’ dying in action, he began to see this as his generation’s war—the epic of his time. He did not want to become yet another regretful old man thinking, Darn, I wish, I wish I woulda. He visited an army recruiter, and three months later, after aptitude testing and the offer of safer military paths, opted for the boots-on-the-ground experience of infantry, because he wanted to know what the thick of things is about.\n\nHis parents were dismayed, but they learned too late to stop him. He was nearly 22 years old. He joined the army on June 18, 2002, and the next day flew off to basic and infantry training at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he flourished. After graduation he was assigned to a base in Germany. Five months later, in March 2003, he went to war in Iraq. His first unit was Bravo Company, Second Battalion, Second Infantry Regiment, of the First Infantry Division. It consisted largely of volunteers who had stepped forward after the 9/11 attacks, and in sufficient numbers to allow the army to set a relatively high standard for recruitment. In Bravo Company the quality showed. The soldiers were well intentioned, collaborative, and serious about their jobs. They did not hate Arabs and were not out to target people or inflict pain. Furthermore, they were led by a crew of pragmatic, evenhanded sergeants, and were overseen by junior officers who were much the same. The mission was a fairly quiet one—to help secure an air base in Kirkuk, a city about 150 miles north of Baghdad, at a time during and just after the invasion, when the population was still subdued.\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/557f1d38320a56cf42411347]|||\nSome members of Alpha Company. Two shown here were accused of murder—the charismatic first sergeant, John Hatley (second from left, rear), and Joseph Mayo (third from left, rear). Cunningham is at far right.\n|||\n\n\n\nIt was a one-year stint. The men camped on the tarmac for the first few months before being provided with shelters and a chow hall. They ranged widely beyond the perimeter, walking through the streets, operating traffic checkpoints, and unearthing vast quantities of munitions from hidden stockpiles that littered the countryside. Some of the munitions they handled may have been chemical weapons, with long-term consequences to themselves. But they came under fire perhaps only twice, and they suffered no losses. So, it wasn’t like the movies. But it was war nonetheless.\n\nCunningham turned out to be good at it. His evaluation sheets rated his performance as excellent in every category and repeatedly recommended that he be promoted ahead of his peers. He rose rapidly to specialist, and soon enough to sergeant. By then the company was back in Germany, training for the next deployment. The war in Iraq was heating up. In June 2005, Cunningham came to the end of his initial commitment and re-enlisted for four more years. He thought he would remain with Bravo Company, but two months later the army deactivated the unit. Cunningham and several friends arranged to get themselves assigned to the First Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment—the 1–26—which was based at a garrison in Schweinfurt, Bavaria, about three hours away. They got there after nightfall and mustered among other inbound soldiers. Suddenly a voice called Cunningham’s name. A senior sergeant came up to him and said, “Sergeant Jess Cunningham? First Sergeant Hatley sent me to get you. You’re now in Alpha Company, 1–18.” Cunningham protested that he had to meet the morning roll call for the 1–26. The sergeant said, “Negative. That’s all been taken care of.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn retrospect there is a whiff of destiny here. The drafting of Cunningham was entirely Hatley’s work—a fate he went out of his way to inflict upon himself. He had recently brought Alpha Company back from a year in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein’s hometown, where they had encountered determined resistance and lost some men to the fighting. In Germany, he was preparing the company for a scheduled return to Iraq, determined to make it the best infantry unit in the field, expressly as a reflection of himself. Within the U.S. Army in Europe, Hatley had his ear to the ground. When he heard of new arrivals, he called his network of friends, the first sergeants and sergeant majors who knew the score. He had a sergeant slot to fill in his second platoon, and he wanted the best soldier for the purpose—a go-getter, a team player, and a “P.T. stud” whose dedication to physical training could match his own. He said, “I want the pick of the litter.” And that is what he got.\n\nCunningham was surprised by the cult of Hatley and felt a little uncomfortable with it, but he was impressed by the man—and for good reason. Hatley was the alpha of alpha males. He was physically imposing and would get into people’s faces if he had to, but intimidation was not primarily the basis of his power—not yet. He was hard-charging, hands-on, versatile, verbal, experienced, politically connected, and obviously intelligent. He knew when to be serious and when to relax. He knew how to approach each individual soldier, and how to approach the group. Every morning, when the men assembled, he would stand in front of them and shout a war cry, and then “P.T.!,” and the company would enthusiastically reply. Because of Hatley, the esprit de corps was high. The mentality was “We’re the best!” Hatley preached it every day. And he gave credit easily. He said, “I’m the best because you’re the best! I’m the best because you platoon sergeants make me look good! You platoon sergeants are the best because your squad leaders make you look good! You squad leaders are the best because your soldiers make you look good! Wolf Pack!” Cunningham bought into it as all the soldiers seemed to. Hatley was invincible. He was the great protector who would keep everyone safe. Cunningham thought, What is not to love about this man? Because Cunningham was not clairvoyant. He did not anticipate the effect of the coming battle, where the power of life and death would be placed in Hatley’s hands.\n\nThen it was early spring 2007, Iraq was up in arms, the fighting in Baghdad had become the sort of war that movies show, five Iraqi men had just been loaded into the back of a Bradley, and Hatley had voiced his intention to murder them. Cunningham was still nominally responsible for the patrol, but he had lost practical authority, and Hatley was now fully in charge.\n\n**III. Beside the Canal**\n-------------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nJohn Edmond Hatley was born in 1968. He was raised in a dismal town in central Texas, where his father was a Baptist preacher and connections to the world were thin. He was disadvantaged by definition. He played some sports. He chased some girls. He dropped out of high school, then worked some menial jobs. He was apparently headed nowhere in life. But in 1989, when he was 21, he drove to Dallas and joined the army. The army was good for him. It did not care about his caste. It found in Hatley the material from which career soldiers are formed, and it gave him the means to elevate himself to a degree that civil society probably would not have allowed. Hatley was hungry for it. He turned out to be better, tougher, and smarter than his peers. At some early point he must have realized this about himself. A certain insecurity never left him. He remained, for instance, painfully proud of his every decoration. Nonetheless the once inconsequential boy became a man who could not be ignored. The unlikeliness of his rise may help to explain his inordinate pride.\n\n\n\nHis rise looked like this: he went from rifleman to armored-vehicle crew member, to squad automatic-weapon gunner, machine-gunner, radio operator, team leader, squad leader, section leader, brigade master gunner, platoon sergeant, division master gunner, and divisional-operations sergeant before becoming the imposing first sergeant of his beloved Alpha Company. He was stationed in the United States, Korea, and Germany, saw combat in the Gulf War, did peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo, and returned to straight-up combat twice in Iraq. Along the way he completed airborne- and jungle-warfare training, excelled in multiple leadership and war-fighting schools, won a Ranger tab, completed high school with a general-equivalency diploma, and earned a year’s worth of college credits through a University of Maryland extension program, where he performed at a nearly straight-A level. The man was better than West Point. He seemed unstoppable, on a path to becoming a command sergeant major, and perhaps the senior NCO for all of the U.S. Army in Europe—the enlisted equivalent of a three-star general. He was married at the time to a Korean-American orphan named Kim, who was raised in New York and came to the marriage with a son. Hatley never had children of his own, but he loved his soldiers paternally and saw himself as their protector—there is no question about that.\n\nIt was at that stage in his life that Hatley came up with the idea of killing the Iraqi detainees. He was fighting a futile war against enemies who dressed in civilian clothes and routinely professed their innocence when captured. Furthermore, if he hoped to ensure their long-term detention—and thereby preserve the lives of his own men—he was saddled with stringent evidentiary requirements that generally could not be met. That was certainly true in this case, where the machine guns had been discovered in a separate house. Here was the deal: you could hold the detainees for “tactical questioning” at the combat outpost for 24 hours, after which you would have to release them to the streets or turn them over to the Iraqi or American authorities, who likely would release them a few days later. During their confinement at the combat outpost, you would learn nothing from them, and they would be subjected to petty abuse (some slapping around, some spinning around, perhaps a bit more) of the sort that was simply dumb. About the most you could do—though in violation of procedures—was to drop them off in a hostile neighborhood on the remote chance that their sectarian enemies would eliminate them on your behalf, which some units were rumored to have done.\n\nHatley was sick of the game. Over the years he had lost too many friends to America’s wars. Despite a lack of sufficient evidence, he was convinced that the five detainees were enemy combatants. Perversely, it may have been the very lack of evidence that turned him toward thoughts of murder. Later he was accused of having done something similar before, and without immediate consequence, but this time he had a problem, and it came unexpectedly in the form of Cunningham and the situation report that had been called in. The existence of the detainees could not now be denied, and Hatley had little choice but to return with them to the outpost for processing. The patrol moved out for the purpose. Little is known of the ride. Hatley sat in his Humvee, accompanied as before by Mayo and Leahy—all of them seething at Cunningham’s interference. Cunningham followed along in his own Humvee, assuming that he had succeeded in thwarting Hatley’s plan but worrying about the reprisals he might face.\n\nPrivate Hartson sat in the Bradley’s troop compartment, guarding the bound and blindfolded men, holding Mayo’s pistol. The light inside was dim. He could not see out of the vehicle and neither knew nor cared where he was headed. He assumed that the detainees were going to be shot. He did not give it much thought. As the junior soldier on the patrol, he deferred to Hatley’s experience and judgment. Nonetheless, as it turned out, he was the only soldier with a chance to develop a sense of the detainees as individuals. Directly across from him sat a boy who seemed impossibly young. Next to the boy sat an ancient man who seemed impossibly old. Next to him sat a military-age male who could not stop crying. In his mind, Hartson called him Crybaby. Across from Crybaby on the opposing bench sat an unusually large man. He became the Big Guy. Next to him sat another military-age male, beside whom sat Hartson, the circle completed. At one point the boy and Crybaby put their heads against the ancient man between them and prayed.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe convoy pulled into the combat outpost and came to a stop. By then Hatley and Mayo had apparently decided on a solution. They dismissed two vehicles and ordered the remaining crews—of Cunningham’s and Hatley’s Humvees, and the Bradley containing the detainees—to prepare to depart again. Cunningham asked why. He says Mayo answered, “Because we’re going to go drop these motherfuckers off.” Cunningham hesitated. Mayo read him correctly and yelled, “Just get in your fucking truck!”\n\nHatley and Mayo went into the Tactical Operations Center and stayed there for about 10 minutes. What happened inside remains unknown. Did they fix the paperwork to indicate their intention to release the detainees? If so, Cunningham was that easily circumvented. Inside the waiting Bradley, Hartson took it upon himself to give the detainees water. To do this he had to reach across them and hold a bottle to their lips, one at a time. He then lit a cigarette for himself, whereupon the Big Guy spoke up in broken English, asking for a smoke. Hartson reached across and gave him a puff, the first of several. Hartson grew curious. He asked the Big Guy if he made bombs and killed Americans. The Big Guy laughed in response, whether out of insolence or fear. The Bradley lurched into motion. Hartson continued to speak to the Big Guy and learned that he had two sons and six daughters. After a while, the Big Guy twisted his torso and offered Hartson a string of prayer beads that he had been fingering with hands bound behind his back. Hartson accepted the gift, but that was all he had the capacity to do.\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/557f1d32ca2dc24e4d26a638]|||\nJames D. Culp, the Texas lawyer who defended Cunningham.\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three-vehicle convoy moved slowly to the west, the Bradley in the lead, followed by Cunningham’s and Hatley’s Humvees. The Bradley’s commander, Sergeant Evoy, radioed Cunningham for directions. “Where are we going?” Cunningham had no idea. He answered, “An I.P. checkpoint.” “I.P.” stood for the Iraqi Police, to whom the patrol could turn over the detainees. This would have been standard procedure. Evoy radioed, “Which checkpoint?” Referring to Mayo and Hatley, Cunningham answered, “I don’t know. Call White 7, call Wolf 7.” At that moment the transponder for Hatley’s Blue Force Tracker switched off. The trackers were G.P.S.-based moving maps in certain Humvees that showed the location of friendly forces. After Hatley’s was switched off, only Cunningham’s remained visible to represent the mission on the army’s screens. Cunningham reacted in anger with repeated calls to Hatley, none of which were answered. The silence was unusual. When finally Hatley had to get on the radio to give directions, he did so with brevity—go left, go right, push forward—and without identifying himself.\n\nThe ride lasted 30 minutes. Darkness gathered. Some of the soldiers switched to night-vision goggles. At the edge of the city they passed through a farming village called Hamdani, which was known to them from previous operations. Hatley directed the patrol into an open field, where he called for a halt by an irrigation canal whose edges were overgrown with reeds. The vehicles fanned out into routine defensive positions, dozens of yards apart, and waited there with the drivers at the wheels and the top gunners scanning sectors 360 degrees around. Cunningham was extremely edgy. After a few minutes, his gunner dropped down and said, “Hey, Sergeant Cunningham, they’re standing behind the truck.” Cunningham snapped, “Who the fuck’s behind the truck? You’re the fucking gunner! Why’d you let them get behind the truck? Why didn’t you pull security?” The gunner said, “No, it’s First Sergeant Hatley, Sergeant Mayo, and Doc Leahy.”\n\nCunningham got out of the truck and found them waiting with pistols drawn. According to Cunningham, Hatley said, “This is your chance. Do you want to help kill them?” Cunningham said, “No, I don’t. I already told you, I’m not down for this.” The three men turned and walked away. Cunningham climbed back into his Humvee. To the soldiers inside, he said, “You guys better see right now who’s in this vehicle, and remember who stayed in this vehicle.” Hatley, Mayo, and Leahy went over to the Bradley and ordered the commander, Evoy, to drop the rear ramp. When the ramp dropped, the light from the inside spilled onto Hatley, standing outside. Hatley told Hartson to switch off the light. Mayo and Leahy pulled the detainees outside. Mayo reclaimed his pistol from Hartson, who walked over to Cunningham’s Humvee and climbed into the back. Hatley, Mayo, and Leahy took the detainees a few feet away to the edge of the canal and lined them up facing the water, beyond view of the soldiers in the Humvees. From atop the Bradley, wearing night-vision goggles, Evoy was the only one to witness the scene directly. He saw the men side by side in a line, still bound and blindfolded, with the company’s triumvirate directly behind them, raising pistols for the executions—Doc Leahy on the left, then Mayo, then Hatley. He did not distinguish between the detainees—which among them was the Big Guy, or Crybaby, or the boy. He saw Doc Leahy fire first, and the victim slump unnaturally. Evoy dropped down into the Bradley to avoid seeing anything else. Sickened, he heard other shots ring out.\n\nDoc Leahy was a left-handed shooter. As the event was later reconstructed, he shot the man in front of him at close range in the back of the head. Unexpectedly, the man fell backward against him as he died. The Iraqi to his right flinched at the sound and turned his head to the left just as Leahy fired at him. The round entered his head around his left ear and exited through his face. He fell onto the ground, where he lay awkwardly on his back, gurgling and moaning. Almost simultaneously, Hatley shot and killed a man, and Mayo shot and killed another. Hatley then came over, looked down at Leahy’s gurgling victim, and dispatched him with two shots to the chest. The fate of the fifth man is unknown. Did he somehow escape, or was he, too, shot then and there? All that is certain is that at least four detainees died that night. After the shooting ended, Evoy went back up to see what was happening. The dead men’s blindfolds were removed, and the flex-cuffs were cut from their wrists. Evoy watched the three shooters kick the corpses into the canal.\n\nThe sound of the gunshots tore Cunningham’s world apart. He sat in shock, wondering about the consequences. Hartson sat behind him, terrified. He thought of the Big Guy, with whom he had been speaking just minutes before; he thought of the prayer beads in his pocket. No one in the vehicle said a word. The bloody blindfolds and flex-cuffs were thrown into the back of the Bradley. Hatley, Mayo, and Leahy then got into their Humvee. Hatley ordered the patrol to return to the combat outpost. When it got there, Hatley gathered the soldiers for a short talk. Memories of his exact words vary, but only to a small degree. According to Cunningham, Hatley said, “Hey, what we did was for Soto and Guerrero. For all our guys who have fallen. This is retaliation, and we won’t have to face these guys again. It stays in this group, this brotherhood, and we’re all on the same page. We dropped them off because we didn’t have the evidence. And don’t worry. If anything ever comes up, it’ll start with me and end with me. I’ll fall on the sword.” Many of the soldiers were impressed. Cunningham was not.\n\nHatley instructed a soldier to remove the flex-cuffs and blindfolds from the back of the Bradley, take them to the burn pit, and destroy them. Cunningham dropped his gear on his cot, grabbed a Gatorade, and went outside to sit on the hood of a Humvee. He was staring into the distance when Mayo came up and told him that Hatley wanted him to write the final patrol report, the so-called debrief.\n\n“Why do I gotta do it?”\n\n“Because you’re the fucking patrol leader. So get your ass inside.”\n\nCunningham suspected that they were trying to make him complicit by getting him to falsify the report. He should have refused to obey, but he was afraid of the fight that would ensue. He was afraid of unknowable consequences too. So he was not the Hollywood hero. He was a normal human being. He did as he was ordered, and under the close supervision of Hatley wrote a deceptive report. The report never went anywhere: apparently it was made to disappear. The paperwork exercise turned out to be a manipulative game. Afterward, Hatley may have thought that he had Cunningham where he wanted him. But Cunningham was deeply disturbed. The parallels with the murder of his friend Chad Yarbrough in the Bakersfield orange grove did not escape him.\n\n**IV. Rebellion**\n-----------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe army takes the high road. It instructs its recruits on their solemn obligation to resist illegal orders, and to report war crimes if they occur. In the field it reminds them repeatedly about the rules of engagement—including that they are not allowed to target civilians, or to rape and pillage, or, for instance, to execute blindfolded suspects who have been lined up beside a canal. Furthermore, it maintains an “open door” policy, under which any soldier of whatever rank can go to his commanding officer to report a violation of any kind. But here was a catch for Cunningham: as a soldier with deep experience in the field, he believed that Hatley’s commanders at both the company and battalion level had effectively ceded authority to Hatley and would align with him in the event of an allegation.\n\n\n\nIn any case, Cunningham was at first too conflicted to contemplate reporting the murders. He withdrew into himself, became a chain-smoker overnight, and began to work out obsessively in the loneliness of the gym. After a month of this he asked a battalion medic for relief, without explaining why. The medic gave him Prozac, then doubled the dose, then graduated him to Effexor. He could not shake feelings of anger and anxiety. He became distant from everyone. He began to confront Mayo in private. The change was obvious to others, and a threat to some. Suddenly, Cunningham was an outcast, whom even lower-ranking soldiers dared to disrespect openly. The most blatant of them was Evoy, the sergeant who from atop the Bradley had witnessed the incident at the canal, and, according to Cunningham, had since taken to wising off to him, calling him a pussy to other soldiers, and saying to Mayo, “Look how I talk to him. He won’t do shit.” Cunningham finally had enough. One night, in the heat of an argument, he yanked Evoy out of the sleeping quarters and punched him full force in the mouth. Evoy fell back against a wall, and Cunningham followed, pulling him down and pummeling him on the ground. Evoy never stood a chance. Soldiers came out of their rooms and pulled Cunningham off.\n\n\nThen came the surprise: Hatley let it slide. Cunningham received no formal warning or note in his record. This appears to have been a strategy intended to avoid a rupture. Eventually, Cunningham assaulted Doc Leahy as well—again with no repercussions. Repeatedly he asked Mayo for a transfer to another unit, and each time he was told no. He says Mayo asked him to consider his soldiers and their families: did he want to expose them to risk in the middle of a war by breaking up the team? Obviously he did not.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nSeveral months after the murders, in the summer of 2007, Cunningham came down with pneumonia. He fought it at the combat outpost, blacked out, woke up in the combat-support hospital in the Green Zone, blacked out, woke up among soldiers in bloody bandages in the tent hospital at Balad Air Base, blacked out, and woke up in a U.S. military hospital in Germany. He lost 30 pounds and nearly died. Once in Germany he recovered quickly. On the day he got out of the hospital, a sergeant called him into an office and gave him some bad news: a Second Platoon patrol had hit a land mine, killing two soldiers and maiming another. Cunningham took it hard. He called his family in Bakersfield and said, “I failed. I was one of the strongest guys in the company, but my body let me down.” They thought he was talking about pneumonia. He did not dare to say that his greatest failure had occurred on the day of the murders. He had tried three times to resist the plan but had never gone far enough. He had allowed Hatley to outsmart him. He had failed his soldiers, failed himself, and failed the memory of Chad Yarbrough.\n\nBy now, Cunningham had decided to report the crime—but only once the company was safely clear of Baghdad and he himself was back in the United States, beyond the reach of Hatley. Meanwhile, however, there was this loss of three men in a single day. Cunningham felt that he should have been with the patrol—that maybe he would have done something differently. He wondered what was going to happen now. Would Hatley dispatch other patrols to seek revenge? Cunningham strained to get out of Germany fast, and two weeks later returned to Baghdad.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/557f1d38320a56cf42411349]|||\nHatley after a raid in western Baghdad.\n|||\n\n\n\n\nIt was still summer, and searing hot. Two more soldiers in Alpha Company had been wounded, and two others were soon to die. Morale was low, and the working atmosphere was ugly. Word of the canal killings had seeped through the ranks. Hatley was still comporting himself as if nothing had changed, but among many of his subordinates the attitude toward him was drifting from devotion toward fear. A sergeant in Hatley’s headquarters platoon confided his own worries to Cunningham, expressing suspicions about wanton killings, particularly at night, by certain gunners who seemed to have joined the army for the express purpose of shooting Arabs. Some of the rumors may have been the result of ugly bravado, but as Cunningham probed he was disturbed by what he heard.\n\nIn particular there had been an incident in January of that year, several months before the killings at the canal. The story had come to him in significant detail. A remotely controlled land mine had exploded ineffectively beside the captain’s personal-security detail—a small armored detachment—and Hatley had rushed to the scene with Doc Leahy and a quick-reaction force. By the time they got there, the apparent triggerman had been brought down with a burst of machine-gun fire that nearly severed his leg but did not kill him. According to later eyewitness testimony, Hatley had him put onto a litter and loaded into the back of a Bradley, where Leahy worked to stanch the bleeding. Hatley announced that they would transport the prisoner to the combat-support hospital. But rather than taking them north and east toward the Green Zone, Hatley directed them west, and after 10 minutes called for a halt on an empty stretch of road. He then pulled the prisoner from the Bradley and, with Leahy’s help, dragged him down an embankment beside the road, where he shot him twice in the chest. He zipped him into a body bag and delivered him to an Iraqi checkpoint, no questions asked. In the Humvee, Leahy complained about the blood on his clothes.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nBy late summer of 2007, Cunningham trusted nearly no one. His was not the only dissenting mind. At around the same time an Alpha Company private named Scott Thomas Beauchamp sent an anonymous firsthand report to *The New Republic,* where his wife was a fact-checker. The magazine published the report under the title “Shock Troops.” It detailed various sorts of misconduct, including running over dogs, the mocking of a disfigured female soldier, and clowning around with a fragment of a child’s skull dug up from a grave. But the report turned out to be impossible to verify, and the magazine was forced into a retraction. Hatley sent an e-mail to a reactionary military blog, the Foxhole, in which he wrote, “I can assure you that not a single word of this was true…. My soldiers’ conduct is consistently honorable…. I’m proud of my soldiers and would gladly give my life for any one of them.” He signed it “Sincerely,” and probably did mean every word he wrote. But Beauchamp’s allegations paled in comparison to what was really going on.\n\nCunningham continued to act out. They had only a few months left to go before returning to Germany. But after a particularly angry confrontation with Mayo in the field, he entered the Tactical Operations Center and told Hatley he would not serve with Mayo any longer. Hatley must have known that it all went back to the killings. He ordered everyone out of the room. According to Cunningham, he said, “You don’t get to make those decisions. I do. I run this company, not the C.O., and not you. I’ve been putting up with your shit for months. And, Sergeant Cunningham, are you trackin’ that I’m not afraid to go to prison?”\n\n“Roger, First Sergeant.”\n\n“Do you know what that means?”\n\n“Roger, First Sergeant.”\n\nCunningham took it as a threat. He left the encounter worried about his safety. Recently he said to me, “Did I think Hatley could have? Yes. Did I know about other cases of him executing and murdering people? Yes. Did I know of situations where he was in combat and shot people down? Yes. So, the temperament was there. Did I think he would really do it to a U.S. soldier?” He hesitated. He sighed. He did not know. He had certainly been frightened.\n\n**V. Article 15**\n-----------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nCunningham was now a pariah. He says warnings spread through Alpha Company to be careful about what was said around him. Thirteen men had been present at the killings at the canal site, and Cunningham was the one who could take them all down. For Cunningham it was a dangerous position to be in. Critics later blamed him for not coming forward at once, but the army has no mechanisms in place that would have whisked him away and protected him. For precisely that reason, war crimes are more common than is generally supposed: they are simply too dangerous to report. A related truth is that some number of soldier suicides in combat zones are not suicides at all—they are murders committed to cover up crimes. At the highest level, American military leaders must be aware of the pattern. They could begin to remedy the problem if they chose to—just as they have in the case of sexual assaults within the ranks, where immediate protections are offered to accusers. But war crimes are different. The United States takes a serious hit every time one is reported. It seems that the leadership would rather not know about them than have to deal with every one that takes place. The consequence, however unintentional, is that soldiers who report war crimes are put in harm’s way. Had Cunningham come forward in Baghdad, he would have been exposed to a battlefield where there were a hundred ways to die. Even silent dissent was tricky for him now.\n\nCunningham tried but could not contain his rage. He was angry not just with Hatley and his sergeants but also with the company’s officers, whom he held ultimately responsible for the company’s actions. When the platoon’s new lieutenant, a fresh West Point graduate named Benjamin Boyd, pressed him one too many times about his attitude, Cunningham turned away from him abruptly, saying, “I have to get out of here before I rip your head off.” Boyd reported Cunningham to the company commander. This forced Hatley’s hand. He dredged up the two prior assault cases, added this case of insubordination, and drew up formal Article 15 charges. Article 15 is a non-judicial disciplinary proceeding by which a commanding officer may demote a soldier, restrict him to base, dock his pay, and require additional duty hours—potentially with career-ending consequences. According to Cunningham, Hatley called him in and showed him the paperwork. He tried to return Cunningham to the fold. He said, “Hey, look, I’m going to give you the answers to the test. You go seek amends. You go talk to Mayo. You apologize your ass off to Boyd. You’re not going to be a problem child anymore. This will all go away.” Cunningham refused. The situation was getting out of control, and Hatley was probably afraid. He had no choice but to send the paperwork up the chain of command.\n\nAlpha Company left Baghdad in November 2007, after 14 months of combat, and returned to the standard hail-the-heroes homecoming at Schweinfurt. Soon afterward, Cunningham was summoned to the brigade commander’s office and formally presented with the Article 15 charges. Hatley and the Alpha Company commander were there. A line on the form allowed Cunningham to invoke his right to a full trial at which he could call witnesses and defend himself—a court-martial. He signed it. The commander was surprised. He said, “Do you know what you just did?”\n\n“I demand a court-martial.”\n\nNo viable defense existed for the misconduct Cunningham was charged with, and a conviction would follow him for the rest of his life. But he was defiant. He told me that this was “one of those ‘fuck you’ things.” He was going to force Hatley and Mayo onto the witness stand and make them squirm. He had been assigned an army lawyer, an inexperienced young captain named Richard Newman, to whom he had confided nothing. He had no intention of bringing up the killings—not here, not now. He wanted to go to court for no better reason than to put up a fight.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nHatley seems to have assumed otherwise, and logically so: why else would Cunningham call for a court-martial except to expose the murders? According to Cunningham, Hatley buttonholed him after they left the commander’s office and said, “It’s that fucking lawyer.” Cunningham denied it. In fact, Newman was as surprised as anyone by the court-martial request. Cunningham had a 2005 Chevy Malibu that he kept in pristine condition. He left the garrison and drove home to an apartment that he shared with another sergeant on the far side of town. Several nights later he found that two of its tires had been slashed. He read it as a warning from Hatley. But if the tire slashing was meant to silence him, it had the opposite effect. For Cunningham it was the last straw. He went to his lawyer and in the strictest confidence explained that the misconduct charges against him stemmed from a much larger problem—a multiple murder beside a canal.\n\nThus began a process, rare for our era, in which a serving soldier—not families, not victims, not the press—dragged the army into confronting a war crime. The path was convoluted. Cunningham says he had no intention of using the information to his advantage in the Article 15 case. He was too angry even to consider making deals with the authorities, and he never did. But Newman was intrigued by Cunningham’s claims. Amidst all the drunken-driving and bar-fight violations that junior military lawyers have to handle, here was a chance for a war-crimes case. Newman phoned his superior, a senior defense counsel and army major named Stephen McGaha, who then contacted Cunningham. Cunningham said that he wanted to come forward with the information. Realizing that Cunningham was at risk of being charged himself unless this was carefully handled, McGaha insisted that he withdraw the self-defeating court-martial request and take the Article 15 punishments. Newman was to gather the war-crimes information in writing and then send it to McGaha for modification into a document that could be presented without disclosing Cunningham’s identity. They would deal with the war-crimes allegations, but only after working out some protection. Cunningham agreed to the plan. The Article 15 hearing was duly held. Cunningham was put on probation and given some extra-duty days—a modest penalty that allowed him to retain his rank.\n\n\n\nNewman, however, had run with the war-crimes story. In defiance of McGaha’s instructions, without the approval of Cunningham, and in violation of attorney-client privilege, he took a barely modified version of Cunningham’s written statement to the Schweinfurt office of the army’s Criminal Investigation Division, the C.I.D. He seemed to think the agents could give his client immunity—despite their explanation that they had no authority to do so. The agents took the written statement and outsmarted Newman into divulging Cunningham’s identity, with no protection in place. Newman had blundered. As Cunningham remembers, Newman came to him and said, “Hey, I think I fucked you.” McGaha eventually pulled Newman from the case and took it on himself, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn January 2008, the C.I.D. began calling in the Alpha Company soldiers to break them down and get them to talk. The interviews were recorded on video and became part of the public record. The agents’ tactics were conventional: having advised the soldiers of their right to legal representation, they relied on the soldiers’ naïve reluctance to ask for it and urged them to man up and confess, which the agents claimed all the others had done. And the agents were sympathetic. They said, “Hey, we get it that those fuckers deserved to die, and Baghdad is tough duty, and we all make mistakes—so you might as well explain your side.” The videos are painful to watch. They show the soldiers proceeding in line to the slaughter. Only Hatley is smart enough to demand a lawyer and terminate the questioning. All of the others start with denials, then waver, then end up baring their souls. These are authentic records of an American tragedy. They are not for casual viewing. Mayo is pathetic, his ambitions shattered. Doc Leahy is forlorn. His initial lies are halfhearted. He seems to be utterly broken by the time he describes the killings.\n\nThe C.I.D. soon had a clear picture of the main events—the murders at the canal as well as the alleged execution of the wounded prisoner on a roadside. The agents never tried to question Cunningham, because he had a lawyer from the start and had already provided a statement—the original one. And the C.I.D. could read the winds. Cunningham may have done the right thing by informing the authorities—Army values! Soldier’s creed!—but he was a snitch nonetheless and had become the most hated man at the garrison. Ordinary soldiers mean-mugged him when he walked by. They stopped and stared. Under their breath they called him “rat” and “bitch.” In their own way, the army prosecutors were going to mean-mug him, too. There was no need for further conversation. They thought they had him in a bag.\n\nWhat they lacked, no matter whom they went after, was corroborating evidence beyond the statements they had gathered. The problem was they had no patrol report from the killings at the canal, no complaints from Iraqis, no identities, no date, and no exact location. They had multiple witnesses and confessions—including from two of the people who had done the shooting—but no bones, no bodies, no remains. Much was later made of this by Hatley and his supporters, as if therefore no crime had been committed. But the likely explanation is either that investigators were looking in the wrong place—the killings had taken place in a remote location and at night, more than a year earlier—or that the bodies had been retrieved by friends and family. Beyond that, it is hardly surprising if residents did not want to cooperate with Americans knocking on their doors.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Hatley was charged with pre-meditated murder for the killing of the single prisoner beside the road and the killing of four at the canal. With slight variations, Leahy was charged with the same crimes. Mayo was charged with pre-meditated murder for his actions at the canal. Almost everyone who had been on that patrol was charged with violations of some kind. And Jess Cunningham himself, who had tried to prevent the crimes, was charged with conspiracy to commit pre-meditated murder.\n\n**VI. The Man from Texas**\n--------------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn Germany, Cunningham’s defense counsel, Major McGaha, was rotated to a new assignment, and another army lawyer appeared—a young captain named Jessica Bossi, who knew she needed help. Bossi advised Cunningham to scrape his savings together and hire a civilian defense counsel—the very best war lawyer he could find. Cunningham did exactly that. Within days he had engaged an attorney in Austin, Texas, named James D. Culp, a former paratrooper and army defense counsel who is highly experienced in war-crimes cases and widely considered to be one of the most effective military-trial lawyers in the field. Culp works for pennies on the dollar, defending soldiers in trouble worldwide. He is an impetuous bear of a man, six feet four inches and physically powerful, with a rapid-fire mind and a sense of humor that can be devastating in front of a jury. He immediately flew to Germany to meet with Cunningham, whom he took on as much as a cause as a client. After looking into the case, he decided that the charge of conspiracy was fatally weak. In legal terms, conspiracy requires a criminal state of mind, a meeting of minds, and action in furtherance of the thinking by anyone involved. Cunningham’s presence at the canal, where by some measure he had guarded the killers during the crime, could maybe be construed as an “action” component, even if his presence was imposed from above. But a criminal state of mind? A meeting of minds? All the evidence pointed in the opposite direction. Culp believed that the charge of conspiracy could not withstand challenge in court. He flew home and began sharpening his knives.\n\nLate 2008. Hatley had long fantasized about Norse warriors and had taken on the identity to the degree of having himself tattooed with Viking symbols and images. But it was hard to live up to that now. He had his own civilian lawyer, a longtime resident of Germany named David Court. Because Hatley insisted on pleading innocent to the murder charges, Court had a difficult case on his hands. On his advice, Hatley demanded a speedy trial. It was a gamble. The idea apparently was to go through the legal process before anyone else, so that the others—because of constitutional protections against self-incrimination—could not be summoned as witnesses. Cunningham was disgusted by the attempt. To me he said, “He showed his true colors right there. He could no longer muscle and intimidate and put the fear into somebody. All the air went out of his balloon. ‘Hey, Hatley, what happened? You were that big saber-wielding, lead-from-the-front macho-man alpha male. What happened to falling on your sword? What happened to it starting and ending with you? What happened to loving your soldiers and thinking of them as your sons?’ But, no, he and his lawyer demand a speedy trial so he can get through everything.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIt didn’t work out that way. Cunningham went first. Culp flew in and joined with Bossi, prepared to do battle over definitions of conspiracy. The court-martial was to take place at the Vilseck garrison, near the Czech border. Culp had already submitted a motion for dismissal, arguing that Newman’s unauthorized delivery of Cunningham’s statement to the C.I.D. rose to the level of ineffective counsel in violation of Cunningham’s constitutional rights, and that therefore the statement and the evidence that resulted from it—meaning everything—could not be used against him. The government had parried with arguments that Culp thought must have seemed even to the prosecutors to be a stretch. The decision would depend on the presiding judge, Lieutenant Colonel Edward J. O’Brien. Culp had tried cases before him in Korea and knew him from Iraq. He thought of him as an excellent, no-nonsense legal mind. On Thursday, February 12, 2009, Culp and Bossi walked in to hash out the arguments in the judge’s chambers. Cunningham was waiting outside. Judge O’Brien started by counting the prosecutors in the room. As Culp recalls, he said, “One, two, three, four. I see four prosecutors and one James Culp. You guys need to go out and get another prosecutor.” The prosecutors smiled at the joke, perhaps thinly. They seemed to take it as a warning of O’Brien’s intentions. Culp introduced new evidence that further eroded their position. The prosecutors conferred briefly and came back to say that they would ask the convening general for permission to drop the charges against Cunningham and offer him unconditional immunity, with no quid pro quo required.\n\nIt was a retreat in anticipation of defeat. The move was formalized within an hour. After months of maneuvering, Culp and Bossi had won conclusively before the trial had even started. Cunningham was stunned. When the prosecutors asked him if he would have a problem with testifying against the others, he said “Nope” without hesitation. For the next four hours, in the company of his lawyers, he went over the story again, and in greater detail than he had previously provided. Suddenly he was the government’s star witness. *Stars and Stripes* and other American newspapers reported that the charges against him had been dropped, but without explanation; officially, Cunningham was an innocent man, but the stain remained. Soldiers in Germany believed he had cut a deal to save his hide. This was untrue, but in the division he was despised.\n\nLeahy’s trial came next. It was a full court-martial, at which Cunningham and others testified. Leahy had confessed to his role; his defense was that he was under immense stress. The jurors did not buy it. They let him off the hook for his admitted involvement in the first killing, but convicted him for the killings at the canal. He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole—a term later reduced by a general’s order to 20 years. Then came Mayo. After learning of Leahy’s sentence, he plea-bargained a term of 35 years—which later was also reduced to 20 years.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nFinally it was Hatley’s turn. He had entered a plea of not guilty. The trial began on April 13, 2009, and lasted three days—long for a court-martial. Security was high, with military police positioned around the courthouse. Cunningham’s was not the only testimony against Hatley; it was corroborated by a string of other Alpha Company soldiers, including Leahy and Mayo. The jury consisted of mid-ranking officers and senior sergeants, none of whom looked happy to be there. Hatley sat straight-backed, chest out, in dress uniform—a soldier’s soldier for all to see.\n\nHe did not testify in his own defense but summoned about 40 character witnesses to speak on his behalf. All of them said he was a great soldier, a great leader, and the best the army had to offer. This is known as the Good Soldier defense, and it is unique to military justice. It allows jurors to hear evidence of good military character in deciding whether a crime has been committed. Congress has stripped this defense from military sexual-assault trials but has allowed it to remain in cases of murder on the battlefield. Among those who provided testimony was Command Sergeant Major Ralph Beam, the senior NCO of the U.S. Army in Europe. In the end, after four hours of deliberation, the jurors found Hatley not guilty of murdering the single prisoner by the roadside, though why they did so is not known. No amount of praise for Hatley, however, could overcome the necessity to hold him accountable for the killings at the canal. The jury found Hatley guilty of pre-meditated murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nHe rose to make a statement. The doors to the courtroom were opened, and soldiers crowded in. Accounts vary, but Hatley drew himself up and declared love for his soldiers and pride for having served with the best damned infantry unit in the United States Army. He did not give an inch. He called out the name “Wolf Pack!” The audience responded with “Hooah!” Hatley was led away in shackles. Later his sentence was reduced to 40 years. He joined Mayo and Leahy in the military’s maximum-security prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where all three are held today.\n\n**VII. Return to Bakersfield**\n------------------------------\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThis is a story that should be taught in army schools. Better yet, it should be studied at a dedicated center for the study of war crimes, the equivalent of an aircraft-accident investigative board where narratives are written, independent of punitive channels. Alpha Company 1–18, Baghdad, the surge. What happened here? How could it have been detected in advance? What are the dangers of esprit de corps? When does a brotherhood become a gang? How does a good soldier turn bad? What is the nature of a good soldier? Is it the same as that of a warrior? What is the balance between narcissism and pride? And, after the fact, what obstacles exist to the reporting of crimes? These are essential questions best explored through history’s examples, but the army is so averse to negative publicity that it allows the memory of war crimes to fade, and tries to proceed just as before. That is what happened here. With Hatley’s conviction and Cunningham’s departure, the story got wrapped into a bundle and dropped out of sight.\n\nThe protagonists, however, continue to live it. Having admitted to their crimes and expressed regret, Leahy and Mayo won approval in May for parole and will be released in the fall of 2015. Hatley is a different matter. He has become an Internet martyr for reactionaries. They believe that he has been unjustly imprisoned for saving American lives by killing terrorists in Iraq. This may indeed be what Hatley thought he was doing beside the canal. And he appreciates the support, as he repeatedly says. The problem with the narrative is that it runs counter to the story he tells, the starting point of which is that no crime was committed because no prisoners were killed. This is what he has consistently maintained on an authorized Web site, and recently in a long letter to me. His version of events is that the patrol came under fire, pursued the aggressors until they were captured, took them back to the combat outpost, then drove them to the canal and released them for lack of evidence; that Cunningham was a violence-prone malcontent; that when Cunningham was threatened with an Article 15 he tried to escape it by inventing the war-crimes story; and that the prosecutors entered into a complex conspiracy so effective that it forced all the witnesses into agreeing about the killing, persuading Leahy and Mayo to confess to murders that never occurred, letting Cunningham off the hook in exchange for his fabricated testimony, and using their wiles to crucify Hatley.\n\nSo, he is innocent and will never admit to the crime. On that basis he filed a legal appeal, which was denied. He then filed a petition to a higher court, which was turned down, and another to the Supreme Court, which never stood a chance. If he serves his full term he will be released in 2049, when he is 80 years old. Chances are he won’t stay in that long. He is first eligible for parole in 2019, when he will be 50, still young enough to rejoin society. Recently he has submitted a petition to the army clemency-and-parole board, asking for special relief. He has been a model prisoner, of course. He has helped to ease tensions among black, white, and Hispanic contingents, and has earned the respect of nearly everyone, including the guards. He has attended the Leavenworth Vocational Barber College and become a licensed barber in the state of Kansas. He has successfully completed 1,080 hours in the prison’s Embroidery Technician Vocational Program. He is currently enrolled in an extension program of Upper Iowa University and hopes to earn an M.B.A. by December 2016. There is no doubt that he has behaved well. But there is a problem with his petition to the board. The requirements for release are tied to the purposes of incarceration, which in the military include rehabilitation. Rehabilitation means a change of heart, demonstrative remorse, and owning up to misdeeds. Because Hatley maintains his innocence, he cannot provide this.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nTwo months after Hatley’s trial, Jess Cunningham came to the end of his enlistment. Honorably discharged from the army, he returned to Bakersfield and civilian life. The first years back were extremely difficult. He received volumes of hate mail through the Internet and found himself isolated from Bakersfield society—nearly the pariah that he had been in the army. Social media were not a help. Women he met looked him up, found the references to war crimes, and walked away. Many of his old acquaintances turned their backs. They no longer knew what to make of him, and did not have the patience to figure it out. At rodeos and football games, people would sometimes take him for his twin brother, then grow awkward when he explained. “Oh, so you’re the soldier one,” they would say, before easing away.\n\nCunningham preferred it that way. He was angry and distrustful. He drank, until he stopped. He kept to himself, and still largely does. But it is getting better now. He has a good job as a roustabout at an oil refinery. He works out at a gym, shoots at a gun range, and sometimes hunts with his cousins in the mountains outside of town. He has an immaculate pickup truck and recently bought a house. But the problem of misunderstanding remains. In 2009, CNN ran a short series on this case, focused largely on the suffering caused to the families of the imprisoned men. Cunningham agreed to talk, despite the advice of Culp. When the reporter came to interview him, she was so uninformed that as a way of breaking the ice she said, as Cunningham recalls, “I have a message for you. Mrs. Hatley would like to say she forgives you.” To me Cunningham said, “I’ve never had one nightmare. I’ve never had one guilt issue about Leahy, Hatley, and Mayo. The only thing that really upsets me is that three times that day I failed to stop them.”\n\nEvery day he thinks about it. His parents tell him he has to let it go, but he cannot. He tells them they don’t understand. He is an extraordinarily gentle and courteous man. He loves the army and is proud to have served two combat tours. But he carries the killings inside his head. As long as he does, in Bakersfield he will always be the outsider, the loner, the soldier one.",

      "hed":"“I Identify as Black,” Rachel Dolezal Says in Defiant Interview",
      "dek":"",
      "channel":"News",
      "subChannel":"Daily News",
      "body":"[#twitter: https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/610771544097165312]\n\n__Rachel Dolezal__, who has dominated the national conversation ever since her biological parents last week revealed that the N.A.A.C.P. chapter president was white, [sat down with the *Today* show’s __Matt Lauer__](http://www.today.com/news/rachel-dolezal-speaks-today-show-matt-lauer-after-naacp-resignation-t26371) this morning, breaking her silence for the first time. \n\nDolezal had been identifying as a black woman, and had identified a black man as her father. On Monday, she resigned from her post as the Spokane, Washington, chapter president of the N.A.A.C.P, an organization formed in the beginning of the 20th century to advocate for the rights of black Americans.  \n\n“The timing of it was a shock. I mean, wow,” Dolezal told Lauer, referring to the revelation that she was white. “The timing was completely unexpected. I did feel, that, at some point, I would need to address the complexity of my identity.” \n\nLauer asked Dolezal a question she had refused to answer in the past: “Are you an African-American woman?”\n\n“I identify as black,” she said.\n\nLauer put a photo of Dolezal on the screen. In the photo, which Dolezal said was taken when she was 16 years old, she has blonde hair and fair skin. “I would say that visibly she would be identified as white, by people who see her,” she admitted on Tuesday. Lauer asked her if she openly identified as black at the time. “In that picture, during that time, no,” Dolezal said, though she said her self-identification as a black person began at a young age. \n\nWhen she was five years old, Dolezal said, she was “doing self-portraits with the brown crayon.” \n\nAsked why she deceived people for so long, Dolezal said that she simply neglected to correct the narrative that developed around her. She used the word “transracial,” and said that a newspaper article once described her as “biracial.” When another article, on alleged racist threats Dolezal was facing, described her as “a black woman,” she again failed to address the inaccuracy. \n\nImages of Dolezal that have proliferated across the Internet since the revelation that she was white show a progressively darkening skin tone and multiple hairstyles. Lauer asked her about those changes, pointedly questioning whether she had purposely darkened her skin. \n\n“I certainly don’t stay out of the sun, and I also don’t, as some of the critics have said, put on blackface as a performance,” Dolezal said. \n\n“I have a huge issue with blackface. This is not some freak, *Birth of a Nation*–style blackface performance,” she said. “This is a very real connection.” \n\nDolezal had previously identified a black man as her father. Asked why she lied, she claimed that he approached her, and that they “connected in a very intimate way, as a family.” \n\nLauer asked Dolezal if her sons believe she’s black. “I was talking to one of my sons yesterday, and he said, ‘Mom, racially you’re human, and culturally you’re black,’” Dolezal said. “I know that they support me—ultimately, we have each others’ backs.” \n\nThe Smoking Gun on Monday [uncovered](http://thesmokinggun.com/documents/bizarre/rachel-dolezal-discrimination-lawsuit-786451) a 2002 lawsuit in which Dolezal alleged Howard University, a historically black university, denied her a scholarship because she was white and pregnant. The suit was touted by many as evidence of Dolezal’s opportunistic relationship with her racial identity. On Tuesday, Dolezal said she still felt she was facing an “injustice” at Howard.  \n\n“The reason for my full-tuition scholarship being removed, and my teaching position as well, my T.A. position, was, ‘other people needed more opportunities, and you probably have white relatives who can pay your tuition,’” she told Lauer. “And I thought that was an injustice.” \n\nDolezal said, looking back, she would have made most of the same decisions. “As much as this discussion has been at my expense, in a very vicious and inhumane way, it’s really about being human,” she said, ticking off a list of terms about identity and race. \n\n“There are probably a few interviews that I would do differently, if circumstances, in retrospect, if I knew what I knew now,” she said. “But my life has been one of survival.”  ",

      "body":"\nStanding in front of the Trump Tower (appropriately), __Donald Trump__ today announced that, for the first time in over 20 years, he would stop [flirting with running for president](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/01/donald-trump-pretending-to-run-for-president-again), and actually launch a campaign for the nation’s top office.\n \nTrump has [yet to actually file his papers with the Federal Election Commission](http://www.fec.gov/press/resources/2016presidential_form2dt.shtml), but that didn’t stop him from putting on a fantastic pep rally.\n\nAfter an introduction by his daughter __Ivanka Trump__, the mogul/celebrity/human wig stand came out to __Neil Young’s__ “Rockin’ in the Free World,” a song initially written [to criticize the first Bush administration.](https://twitter.com/AndrewKirell/status/610825454388428801)\n \nBemoaning the lack of American victories on all fronts—trade deals, economics, the lack of border control, the fight against ISIS, Obamacare, you name it—Trump positioned himself as the only man competent enough to handle them. “I beat China all the time!” he boasted at one point, and later bragged that he was in competition with ISIS, which recently built a hotel in Syria. “Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the day, and we as a country are getting weaker,” he insisted. At one point, he cited the fact that he could build a Web site better than healthcare.gov (“I have so many Web sites”), and promised to repeal Obamacare.  \n \n“They will never make America great again,” he said of his opponents. “They don’t even have a chance. They’re controlled fully by the lobbyists, the donors, the special interests.”\n \n“All of my life I’ve heard that a really, really successful person cannot run for public office and yet that’s the kind of mindset you need to make this country great again,” he continued. “So ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again.”\n \nThe strains of “Rockin’ in the Free World” briefly played for three seconds before he resumed his speech.\n \nPromising to rapidly grow the American economy (“I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created”) and re-establish American power abroad with the combination of military force and free trade (“I know the best negotiators in the world”), Trump finally turned to the one thing that would insulate him from influence bought by lobbyists, donors, and foreign entities: “I’m really rich. I’m not bragging.” To signal that he was completely serious about his run, Trump disclosed his net worth to comply with campaign-finance laws: roughly $8,737,540,000, including both assets and liabilities. \n \nWithin minutes, the Democratic National Committee [welcomed him to the race](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/06/dnc-trolls-donald-trump-response), saying they were looking forward to his \"much-needed seriousness\" in the G.O.P. field.\n \nPolls seem to reflect his confidence in 2016: according to RealClearPolitics’ poll average, Trump [currently ranks ninth.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html) In a normal election cycle that would be rock bottom, but with over 20 G.O.P. candidates, either declared or considering a run, Trump is a solid mid-field candidate, which says a great deal about . . . something.",

      "body":"Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, who is running for president, says he is personally opposed to gay marriage but takes the position that this is a matter for each of the 50 states to decide for itself. Nice try, Governor, but that train has pulled out of the station. The country has already accepted gay marriage, and it’s too late for half-measures. “Leave it to the states” is a hoary evasion for national politicians who want to duck a troublesome issue, but it’s not available to Walker, because governors of states can’t duck an issue by saying it should be decided by the states. Well, they can try, but they shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it. You are the governor, Governor. Man up (as Sarah Palin used to say) and tell us where you stand.\n\nIt’s remarkable that a Republican running for the Republican nomination for president should need to be evasive about marriage equality, as opposed to using it as a cudgel. There were days, not long ago, when Republicans used to fabricate issues like this in order to embarrass the Democrats. Elderly readers may recall 1988, when George H. W. Bush beat Michael Dukakis in a vicious campaign almost entirely about artificial issues concocted in the G.O.P. laboratory, like the urgent need for an amendment to the Bill of Rights against burning the American flag. Twenty-seven years later the Bill of Rights remains pristine, there has been no serious effort to pollute it with an anti-flag-burning amendment, and yet there has been little if any flag burning going on. It will not be an issue in the 2016 campaign. There may be some vestigial sentence in the Republican Party platform, but no podium time will be wasted on it.\n\n\n\nRegarding abortion—a genuine social issue—something similar has happened. Few people have actually changed their minds about the morality or legality of abortion, but Republicans don’t look forward to arguing about it on the campaign trail. They wish it would just go away. They may honestly believe that human life begins at the moment of conception, or they may have adopted that position cynically, but in most places the candidates would just as soon not dwell on it.\n\nAbortion, marriage equality, gun control, drugs, prayer in the schools, affirmative action, the “War on Christmas”: these are all classified as “social issues” (as opposed to economic and foreign-policy issues) and have generally been regarded as “wedge issues” too—issues that the Republicans can use like a wedge to pry voters away from the Democrats. But the wedge isn’t what it used to be.\n\nIn 2004, a writer named Thomas Frank wrote a terrific book called *What’s the Matter with Kansas?,* which immediately became a classic. It was an attempt to solve a puzzle. Why, when people are upset about the economy, concerned about their jobs, resentful of growing income inequality, tired of watching industries move overseas, and generally sullen about money—why, with all this, do they nevertheless keep voting Republican? Frank’s answer was, in short, that the Republicans use social issues in a bait-and-switch routine: people are enticed into voting Republican over social issues like abortion or gay marriage, and then Republican pols, once elected, ignore all that and govern like the pro-business, rich-people’s party that they are at heart.\n\n[#image: /photos/557afca0320a56cf4240fc60]|||\nAbsurd class arguments have marked every recent presidential contest. Illustration by Barry Blitt.\n|||\n\n\nFrank’s book is a bit of a cartoon, and this is a bit of a cartoon summary. But the Frank Thesis seems basically right. Or at least it seemed right until this year. Times have changed. It’s unlikely that the fall campaign in 2016 will be dominated by social issues. Why? A few possible reasons.\n\nFirst, people have finally come to understand that many of these issues were phony distractions from what’s really important and what a president can do something about, which is primarily the economy. In other words, the Frank Thesis no longer applies.\n\nSecond, although objectively the next four years look better economically than the four years after 2004 turned out to be, people sense correctly, as they did not back then, that something more dramatic than the business cycle is going on—that those midwestern middle-class jobs that went away probably are not coming back.\n\nThird is the presence of Rand Paul in the Republican primaries. Paul is a libertarian who has no time for laws imposing one person’s idea of appropriate behavior on another person who disagrees. Paul and Mephistopheles meet once a week to discuss how far Paul will have to go in compromising his libertarian values in order to have a shot at the nomination. But even though Paul has been compromising like mad lately, his very presence onstage will drive opponents toward the libertarian side of the Republican spectrum.\n\nFourth, and finally, there is gay marriage (or “marriage equality,” as its advocates prefer to say). It used to be something Republicans deployed in order to taunt Democrats. Now it’s the reverse. In terms of “hot button” issues—ones that work for fund-raising and getting out the vote—marriage equality is off the list. In fact, it’s on the other list: the list that can get you (and your business) ostracized if you don’t support it.\n\nIf wedge issues are blunted, what will take their place? My guess is it will be class warfare of the most pathetic kind.\n\nSince at least 1988, with George Bush the Elder’s impressively demagogic campaign against a stunned Michael Dukakis—that was the year of the infamous “Willie Horton” ad—and arguably back to 1968 and Nixon’s “southern strategy,” an attempt at class war has been a part of the Republican playbook. It wasn’t always easy to persuade people that white males in business suits and other Republican-looking types were the oppressed of our society and that black single mothers and pointy-headed professors were the oppressors. But the Republicans managed to do it—at least in 1988, when they repositioned George Herbert Walker Bush as a pork-rind-chewing cowboy Everyman and Michael Dukakis, a barely-off-the-boat ethnic, as his Establishment overlord.\n\nSince then, absurd class arguments have been a feature of every presidential campaign. The Clintons, for example, have been attacked from both directions. At first they were portrayed as hillbillies from a small and backward state, trying to rise above their station. Now they’re portrayed as globe-hopping elitists, observing the real America from 30,000 feet. (Both views have some validity. Both are tremendous exaggerations.) To me, this sounds like the American Dream—from hillbilly to world leader in one generation! Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Republican opponent in the race for senator from New York, Rick Lazio, charged that she rode around in limousines, whereas he, a normal guy, took the subway. Then, unfortunately, someone asked him how much a subway card cost. He wasn’t sure.\n\nThis year, an early lead in populist demagoguery has been taken by Scott Walker, who declared in April that Hillary Clinton “probably” has never shopped at Kohl’s. That may be true, although I’m sure she’s been to China, which is “probably” much the same thing. I have shopped at Kohl’s many times—in the sense of examining the merchandise, if not in the sense of actually buying something. (“Darling,” says Arianna, “I love Kohl’s. I always go there for anything I can’t find at Costco, Target, J. C. Penney, Sears, or Kmart.”) Expecting accusations of elitism, Hillary was ready when the accusations arrived. She did what any American would do: she hopped in her van and headed for Iowa. Road trip! She stopped for lunch at a Chipotle restaurant in Ohio, a state famous for its Mexican food. So there! Your move, Governor.\n\nIt’s obviously more important that our next president shop at Kohl’s than that she or he have any notion of what’s going on in, say, the Middle East. And Walker is no neophyte at this game of competitive normality. What will he do now? He might invite the media to watch him washing his car on Sunday (after church, of course). In response, Hillary might bake some cookies, which she once, long ago, back in 1992, said she would not do. Hey, it’s a flip-flop! How will Hillary overcome this setback?\n\nAfter consulting half a dozen advisers, she may decide to do a load of laundry in public. This raises the troublesome issue: should we separate the lights from the darks? “I personally oppose a ‘separate but equal’ or ‘two load’ solution, but I will leave that sensitive matter to be decided by the states,” Hillary will say. “That’s what normal people do, isn’t it?”",

      "body":"[#video: //www.youtube.com/embed/0lUusnn7puQ](640x480)||||||\n\nAs we slowly approach the November 6 premiere of *Spectre*, the latest installment in the James Bond film franchise, we are collecting small clues about 007’s upcoming exploits. For instance, __Daniel Craig’s__ Bond will speed through the streets of Rome [in an epic car chase](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/04/james-bond-spectre-car-chase) with Mr. Hinx (__Dave Bautista__)—Bond in his signature Aston Martin and Mr. Hinx in a high-powered Jaguar. And now, we know how director __Sam Mendes__ will try to top the wonderfully frenetic first sequence in 2012’s *Skyfall*, which involved 007 and Moneypenny weaving through Instanbul’s colorful street markets (and innocent bystanders) while chasing a mercenary. (Because this was a Bond movie, the sequence also involved our eternally suave, impeccably suited spy motorbiking across rooftops and and engaging in a gunfight atop a moving train.)\n\nIn a new behind-the-scenes featurette, Mendes reveals that *Spectre* opens with Mexico City’s vibrant Day of the Dead festivities. “I wanted the audience to be dropped right into the middle of a very, very specific, very heady, rich environment,” Mendes explains of his motivation. “Everywhere you look there’s color and detail and life. We’ve built floats and maquettes, the costumes are extraordinary and the craftsmanship is amazing.” \n\nLest you doubt Mendes’s word, the featurette includes a preview of the film’s elaborate Día de Muertos recreation, which involved 1,500 (!) extras, each wearing intricate makeup and different, custom-made wardrobes created by the costume department over the course of six months. That feat alone seems worthy of an Oscar nomination.\n\n*Spectre* co-stars __Monica Bellucci__, __Léa Seydoux__, __Christoph Waltz__, __Ralph Fiennes__, __Naomie Harris__, and __Ben Whishaw__, and opens in theaters on November 6.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/547fba036134dc7429747a02]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n",
