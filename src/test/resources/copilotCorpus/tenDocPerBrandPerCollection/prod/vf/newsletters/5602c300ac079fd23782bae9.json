      "body":"Since its first trailer debuted, and maybe even before that, *Stonewall*, __Roland Emmerich’s__ dramatization of the 1969 riots at Stonewall Inn, a seismic event credited with kicking off the modern gay-rights movement, has been met with dread. Partly because, yes, it’s Roland Emmerich, the mega-schlock auteur behind disaster flicks like *The Day After Tomorrow*, *Independence Day*, and *2012*, and outright disasters like *Godzilla*. He’s certainly a strange fit for a piece of relevant political rabble-rousing. (*Day After Tomorrow* could *maybe* be seen as a climate-change call to action, but then the C.G.I. wolves show up.) So, there was some trepidation about that, certainly.\n\nBut more troubling was how Emmerich seemed to be framing the story, with __Jeremy Irvine__ playing some beautiful, blond angel from the Midwest, sent to the Village to marshall the non-white, gender-queer street kids into action. Which, y’know, is certainly not how the Stonewall riots, which were largely incited by drag queens and trans women of color and lesbians, actually happened. And yet there was Irvine in the trailer, looking corn-fed and fit in a white T-shirt, while various characters closer to the demographic of the real Stonewall rioters slinked around him in the dark. So, there was hue and cry about that, as well there should have been. \n\nSome dumb part of me, though, found myself giving *Stonewall*, and Emmerich, the benefit of the doubt. I rather enjoyed Emmerich’s other recent out-of-the-box film, the surprisingly affecting 2011 Shakespeare-authorship drama *Anonymous*, a piece of historical hogwash that was nonetheless lovingly, thoughtfully made. Maybe Emmerich could bring the same personal sensitivity to *Stonewall*, a movie he’s reportedly wanted to make for a long time. Plus, in 2015 a movie couldn’t be *that* tone-deaf about its politics and its optics, right? Surely they were just using sort-of-a-name Jeremy Irvine to advertise the film, while in actuality, the movie is the fair, appropriately representative ensemble piece that a story like this requires. That was my naïve hope, anyway.\n\nTurns out, *Stonewall* is perhaps even *worse* than some feared it would be—more offensive, more white-washed, even more hackishly made. It’s so bad that it’s hard to know where to begin a catalogue of the film’s sins. Maybe you start with its leering, bizarrely sex-shaming tone, which has poor cherubic baby-hunk Danny (Irvine)—kicked out of his house by his football-coach father after he’s caught giving the quarterback, yes the quarterback, a blow job—being preyed upon by gross, sweaty, teen-hungry older men upon arriving in New York. In two different scenes, Danny cries pitifully as one of these horrible, horrible men (one of them in grotesque drag) fellate him. (He needs the money, and is then turned out against his will.) Danny shuns the advances of any younger man who isn’t strapping and white, particularly those of __Jonny Beauchamp’s__ Ray/Ramona, a queer Latino street kid who has a big crush on pretty-boy Danny. \n\nRather horrifically, it’s taken as a given, an implicit fact, that Danny could never, ever fall in love with, or have sex with, someone like swishy, gender-fluid Ray. No, no, people like Ray are meant to forever pine in the shadows for American godlings like Danny. But when __Jonathan Rhys Meyers’s__ character successfully seduces Danny, while playing “A Whiter Shade of Pale” on a jukebox no less, it’s understood to be O.K., because he’s at least a somewhat masculine white guy. In that scene, Emmerich keeps cutting back to Ray’s sad expression as he watches the seduction happen, and though Danny is largely meant to be the audience’s safe, easy stand-in, in that scene I think Emmerich wants us to sympathize with Ray. \n\nBecause surely we all wish we could be with a Bel-Ami certified twunk like Danny, right? Well some of us do, sure, but of course plenty of other people are instead into what Ray is selling, or any of the other non-white or non-butch hustlers who populate *Stonewall* but get only a minimal, pat-on-the-head kind of attention. The movie could never even consider such a possibility, though. Here is a startlingly direct exercising of entitlement: “Yeah, I know in real life it happened to *those* people, but wouldn’t it be better if it happened to someone like *this*?” \n\n*Stonewall* insists, with its hokey story about Danny’s personal growth and struggles with his family back home in Indiana, that what actually happened isn’t good enough. That no one will care unless there’s a beautiful young white man at the center of the story. Because who is more wonderful, compelling, appealing than that? Which may sadly be the opinion of certain corners of the market, but who cares about those people. They have plenty of movies made for them. Meanwhile, there are plenty other recent movies that *aren’t* catered to their narrow tastes but that have done just fine. \n\nWhat this really is, I think, is the filmmakers tending to their personal preferences and prejudices, and then blaming the system. Darn it, this is how it *has* to be, because that’s how the world is. We have to literally see a black character *hand Danny a brick* so Danny can be the first to throw it and the first to cheer “Gay power!” (This is the moment my screening audience, of professional critics, was lost to groans and laughter for the rest of the movie.) We simply must redirect as much history as possible through a white, bizarrely heteronormative lens, or else, the thinking goes, no one will care. People like Emmerich throw up their hands at this supposed inevitability and say, “That’s just the way it is.” \n\nWhich, of course, is nonsense. When *Straight Outta Compton* is earning $60 million on its opening weekend, it’s nonsense. When *Tangerine* is earning rave reviews and art-house dollars, it’s nonsense. When a show like *Transparent* is winning Emmys, it’s nonsense. But *Stonewall* demands that we accept Emmerich’s evasive, self-serving sociology and then has the audacity to ask that we be moved by it. We’re not. \n\nAside from its offensiveness, *Stonewall* is, plain and simple, a terribly made movie, with an alarmingly clunky script by acclaimed playwright __Jon Robin Baitz__ (“I’m too angry to love anyone right now” is one howler—of course delivered by Danny to poor, still pining Ray) and a production design that makes late 1960s Christopher Street look like *Sesame Street*. The story plunks along, until the riots rather unceremoniously, and confusingly, begin, and then the movie hobbles lamely to a close, giving us a resolution to the family-strife plot that’s the least interesting thing in the movie. Emmerich takes one of the most politically charged periods of the last century and turns it into a bland, facile coming-of-age story. \n\nThroughout all this, Irvine looks good in the aforementioned T-shirt, but that’s about all he does. Beauchamp at least offers some glimmers of life, but Ray is so tragically, meanly written that there’s only so much that can be done to turn him into a human. Real-life Stonewall hero Marsha P. Johnson only gets a little screen time, and is played as comic relief, flatly, by __Otoja Abit.__ Many of the characters who don’t look and sound like Danny are rendered as jokes, silly people who need Danny’s relatively rugged masculinity to get them angry and organized. *Stonewall* is ultimately yet another cartoonish fantasy about white saviors and square-jawed heroes; it should be called *Independence Gay*. \n\nMaybe it’s asking too much to get a smart, accurate Stonewall movie. After all, a heck of a lot of straight history has been schmaltzified by Hollywood, neatly edited and tidied up, so why shouldn’t gay history get the same shitty treatment? But that this film was directed by a gay man, written by a gay man, with an obvious intent to educate, uplift, and inspire, in this particular political climate, and is *still* so maddeningly, stultifyingly bungled serves only to show us how ridiculous the concept of a monolithic “gay community” really is. *Stonewall* at least does that bit of good: it illustrates how systems of privilege and prejudice within a minority can be just as pervasive and ugly as anything imposed from the outside. And that’s an outrage. So how long until someone throws a brick through the screen?",

      "body":"Shortly after a poll indicated that conservative Christians were concerned that he’d never asked God for forgiveness, __Donald Trump__ announced that he has, indeed, asked God for forgiveness, but in his “own way.”\n \nTrump, a self-described Presbyterian whose ascendancy in the Republican primary race has placed his religious beliefs under scrutiny, [told a Christian evangelical radio show](http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2015/09/21/video-exclusive-donald-trump-tells-brody-file-its-important-to.aspx) that not only does he think it’s important to ask God for forgiveness, he’s done so, somewhat.\n \n“I think [asking for forgiveness is] great,” he told *The Brody File.* “I consider communion to be a very important thing. You know, when I go to church and I take communion I consider that asking for forgiveness in my own way. And I do think it’s a great thing and I think it’s an important thing and it makes you feel good.”\n \n(Technically, worshippers are supposed to ask for forgiveness before taking communion.) \n \nThe re-evaluation of his relationship with God came after Iowa's Christian voters heard about statements Trump made in Iowa back in July, when he [admitted](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/politics/trump-has-never-sought-forgiveness/) that he didn’t think he’d ever asked God for forgiveness. According to the [Bloomberg/*Des Moines Register* poll](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-21/trump-says-he-asks-god-for-forgiveness-in-my-own-way-), 59 percent of likely Republican voters who identified as Christian said they were “bothered” by that statement. (Overall, however, only 36 percent of likely Republican voters were bothered.)\n \nTrump's confessions, however, must be so peculiar that one has to imagine what those talks are like:\n \n>Our Father—I’m sorry. I’m sorry. “Our” Father? Look, it’s a—when did the personal relationship with God become socialized? No one else will say it, God—no one will give it to you straight, because they’re all bought by very, very rich men—but I will, because I’m a really rich guy.\n \n>Anyways. Father, who art in Heaven—you know, Father, if you ever decide to move, I have a very beautiful Heaven of my own. I do. I built it from the ground up. You know what, I’ll let you stay in Trump Heaven if you ever decide to come to New Jersey—hallowed be thy name. And I like you, God. I hope to behold your divine face one day. But I’m gonna be the only one who says it like it is. When I get up there, on day one, all the lost souls? Back to Purgatory.\n \n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55f9946a200c34353591eda0]||||||\n\n\n",

      "body":"J.K. Rowling continues to sprinkle tidbits of the backstory on everyone’s favorite boy wizard over on the [Pottermore](https://www.pottermore.com) Web site. It’s like J.R.R. Tolkien’s *The Silmarillion* for the digital age. The latest story traces the origins of the Potter clan and connects the dots of how Harry’s handy invisibility cloak went from being a Deathly Hallow to the favorite accessory of James Potter in his Marauders days. Better yet, there’s a new report that scientists are working on a technology that could someday result in invisibility cloaks for all of us. Think of the mischief you might manage! \n\nFirst, the Potter backstory. This is admittedly a somewhat drier entry into Potter lore, but if you simply enjoy living in the rich world Rowling has created, then this little tale of the Potter invisibility cloak may be right up your Diagon Alley. The latest article—“The Potter Family”—traces Harry’s family back to the 12th century. The Potters are the descendants of Linfred of Stinchcombe, a “locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer,’ became corrupted in time to ‘Potter.’” As for the cloak: \n\n> Linfred’s eldest son, Hardwin, married a beautiful young witch by the\n> name of Iolanthe Peverell, who came from the village of Godric’s\n> Hollow. She was the granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell. In the absence\n> of male heirs, she, the eldest of her generation, had inherited her\n> grandfather’s invisibility cloak. It was, Iolanthe explained to\n> Hardwin, a tradition in her family that the possession of this cloak\n> remained a secret, and her new husband respected her wishes. From this\n> time on, the cloak was handed down to the eldest in each new\n> generation.\n\nDumbledore made sure that tradition carried on to include Harry. \n\n[#image: /photos/5601747d3a02e0b16051f6b2]||||||\n\nNow as for the news that you might one day have an invisibility cloak to pass down to the eldest witches and wizards in your family? *Popular Mechanics* [reports](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/news/a17386/invisibility-cloak-xingjie-ni-pennsylvania-state-university/) that a team of scientists at Pennsylvania State University just presented a cloaking substance “that takes the form of a sleek skin of nano-material. . . . At 80 nanometers thick, the skin-like material is 1,000 times thinner than a human hair—just twice the width of a flu virus.” Well, given that the low-rent invisibility cloaks in *Harry Potter* are made from the hair of the mythical Demiguise beast, I’d say science is right on track to outdo the sleek design of Rowling’s imagination. \n\nBut we’re not quite there yet. So far the nano-material only works on small objects, not Harry-size humans. But the project’s leader, Xingjie Ni, said he “can see the potential to scale this up to the size range of centimeters or even meters, by using a different fabrication technique.” \n\nThe bigger obstacle between this scientific project and *true* sneaky Marauders status is that Ni’s nano-material isn’t see-through. *[Popular Mechanics](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/news/a17386/invisibility-cloak-xingjie-ni-pennsylvania-state-university/)* clarifies that “the cloak cleverly reflects light to create the illusion that a bulky object is entirely flat. So, rather than hiding Harry in a hallway, you could imagine such a cloak one day concealing something like a micro-sized listening device on a wall or mirror.” Well now, this is starting to sound like a toy for the C.I.A. or Argus Filches of this world, and not for mischief-making Potters. \n\n[#image: /photos/560178403a02e0b16051f6c5]||||||\n\nGuess we’ll have to keep waiting for our own invitation to Hogwarts and the delightfully mysterious family heirlooms that will no doubt come with it. \n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/54cc2407fde9250a6c419b0e]||||||\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body":"As one of the few humans on Earth who un-ironically calls himself a “TV magic obsessive,” let me tell you, there’s never been a magic show on television like *Penn & Teller: Fool Us.* \n\nI approach the show from several perspectives. As a layperson, it’s entertaining as hell with a clear-cut premise. *Fool Us* is a magic competition on the CW Television Network  in which performers try to fool __Penn Jillette__ and __Teller__ as to how their trick was done. If they succeed, the aspiring magicians win an opening-act slot in the duo’s longtime Las Vegas show. The show has been a surprise ratings hit in its Monday primetime slot, averaging 2 million viewers (it’s been renewed for a third season).\n\nI also watch the show as a guy interested in magic since age six. I’m comfortable saying *Fool Us* has advanced the art form within popular culture better than any televised magic show in recent memory. The variety of magic subgenres given the spotlight is encouraging for those of us who don’t perform with live tigers: there’ve been acts of coin and card magic, mind-reading, escapology, quick change (where costumes transform in a flash)—even a man who solves Rubik’s cubes, *magically.*\n\nAfter each magician’s performance, Penn and Teller confer, and using their combined century of conjuring know-how, try to work out the trick’s method without revealing its secret. This postmortem is the most fascinating part of the show. Listen to how Penn (and Teller, in his silent advisory role) discuss insider terms, something considered by some magicians as heresy. Terms like “cooler,” “McCombical decks,” “Tamariz,” and “Aronson” are of little meaning to 99.997 percent of the viewing audience, and indeed, host __Jonathan Ross__ would often express a quizzical, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” But to hear allusions to method in a public forum, even with such cryptic jargon, certainly breaks new ground for magic on television.\n\nIn the clip below, a magician manages to get one by Penn and Teller—and piss off Penn by doing so:\n\n\n[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCFXV6o7cro](854x480)||||||\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are those who view Penn and Teller as magic turncoats, because they dare to allow the public in on a method or two. (In one of their best-known routines, they perform the “cups and balls” trick with clear plastic cups, ostensibly showing where the sleight of hand takes place.) These are the magicians whose relationship with secrets is ironclad: if you even once reveal the workings of a trick, you’re excommunicated from the fraternity.\n\nIn the magic community, you’ll find backlash to the show for the aforementioned reasons, but most magicians I know view *Fool Us* as a net positive. It has nothing to do with fooling audiences. Really, the phrase “fool us” is the pithy elevator pitch to get on network television. The greater motivation of the show, I think, is having experienced magicians cogently articulate the merits of a performance, which in turn helps the lay public better appreciate magic. Trust me, you’re better off having Penn and Teller explain what’s good about a magic act than Scary Spice or __Howie Mandel.__ \n\nI spoke with Teller (now his full legal name), the famously silent partner of Penn, about *Fool Us*, magic, and the sanctity of secrets.\n\n__*Vanity Fair:* Having a magic show called *Fool Us* would lead most to believe the end goal of magic is to fool someone. I suspect your motivation is more nuanced than that.__\n\n*Teller*: What’s the end goal for any work of art? The answer is it’s not one thing. In almost every work of art there is on one level—and this is the level at which magic is, I think, the most fundamental—at which you must amaze the audience. When you’re an actor, you must, for the moment you’re there, convince the audience that you are possessed by the spirit of this character. And there is a level in which you go, “Wow, I really thought for that moment, that the character onstage was Hamlet.” That amazement is the bottom line of any work of art.\n\n__Magicians get into magic because they’re seduced by the feeling of amazement. The ironic thing is, the deeper they dive into magic, the less often they get fooled. That seems immeasurably cruel.__\n\nThe deeper you get into magic, the more profound your amazement becomes. There’s an intermediary stage where you go, “Oh, is that all there is? It was just a thread?” And then when you work with a thread for four years, and you work out what must exactly be done to make that thread into something that is profound and difficult to imagine could be the cause of whatever it is you’re doing to it, you veer right into a different kind of amazement. It’s the amazement of the knowledgeable person. It’s the amazement of the astronomer who has studied everything about the stars that is available, and who sees and understands the mechanisms that we know about, but is able to appreciate how mysterious it all is in the larger picture.\n\n__So you can be just as amazed by the thought process that goes into creating a trick?__\n\nThere’s a trick I do in our live show based loosely on David P. Abbott’s Floating Ball. I experimented with that trick for 18 months to come up with a routine in which the idea was no longer the ball was going to float, but the ball was coming to life. I spend one hour onstage every night after my show experimenting. And the more I experimented, the more wondrous the situation got for me. I was no longer wondering at the same thing the audience was wondering at. I was in astonishment at how the simple idea of a thread with an angle of something riding on it; the variety of incredible illusory movements it could provide. \n\nPenn introduces that trick in our show by saying, “Now here’s a trick that’s done with a piece of thread.” We say that ahead of time because what we discovered was an audience accustomed to elaborate mechanical and electronic modes of propulsion was inclined to think the movement of this red ball was just some sort of remote-control thing. Whereas magicians who knew how the trick was done appreciated the fact that at every moment, I was disproving the possibility of the thread that they knew was there. So by letting the audience in on the fact that it was done by means of a thread, we created more amazement.\n\n__The fact you let people in on the modus operandi makes it no longer feel like a confrontational relationship with the audience. The magician isn’t saying, “I’m superior to you because I fooled you,” but, “Let’s share in this amazing moment.”__\n\nLong ago, when we originated our clear “cups and balls” routine, we were taken to task by a number of magicians who said, “You’re exposing the cups and balls!” What they didn’t realize was the trick did not originate with the idea of exposure. The trick originated . . . I’ll demonstrate for you . . . \n\n[*We’re sitting at a bar, and Teller gets a clear cup and balls of aluminum foil from a nearby table.*]\n\nPenn and I were sitting in a diner, and I was messing around with rolled-up napkins. As I’m talking I’ll often fiddle with stuff. I noticed that when I did that move, one didn’t see the load, even though it was in full view.\n\n[*Teller makes one ball disappear from his hand, and it reappears inside the clear plastic cup sitting on the table.*]\n\nThat phenomenon of your attention being taken away from something by a very natural action seemed to be truly, profoundly amazing. The subject for a piece of magic. So we developed a routine with clear cups, but of course, it would seem pretentious for us to say, “Note how you could both see the secret action and the ostensible action at the same time! Isn’t that an interesting counterpoint?” So we decided to present it as though it was an exposé, and magicians of course being terribly naïve, believed us. \n\nWe were taken to task by one magician who came to our show and took a swing at Penn in the lobby for the evil that we were doing. Penn said, “Why don’t we just go to the diner and have a chat?” So this magician sat down with us and said, “All right, whose side are *you* on anyway?” That’s the fundamental problem with much of magical performance. Merely because a magician is trying to create a moment in which a spectator is astounded, the magicians often conceive of themselves as being in opposition to their audience. That is something Penn and I are violently against. We do not believe the audience is stupid. We believe many, many, many, many—perhaps most of the audience—is a great deal smarter than we are. Therefore, they need to be shown the respect to be treated as peers.\n\n\n[#image: /photos/56004f76accf6caa52fb8da9]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n__Are magicians a territorial bunch?__\n\nThere’s an aesthetic rule in magic that to allow the audience to be amazed, you don’t explain your trick. That part of your job is to withhold and conceal certain pieces of information in order to bring the audience to a level of astonishment. It is an aesthetic rule, not a moral rule. However, it has gradually seeped into magic lore as being a moral rule. “Giving away a trick is an evil deed.” No it’s not! The person who wrote the magic book that got you started in magic gave away a trick. Was that an evil deed? No!\n\nIn *Tim’s Vermeer*, our friend Tim Jenison believes that he has discovered the method by which Vermeer got such photo-realistic effects. Knowing that does not in any way diminish my astonishment at looking at a Vermeer painting. Alexander Pope wrote, “A little learning is a dangerous thing/ drink deep, or not taste the Pierian spring.” He’s talking about exactly that. A little learning can spoil magic. A lot of learning enhances it.\n\n__Let’s talk about *Fool Us*. What’s your end goal for the show?__\n\nOne of the problems with magic on television is home viewers generally have a feeling the depiction of the magical event is being slanted by the way it’s shot. Anyone who claims they can watch a piece of magic without trying to figure out how it’s done is lying. One of the fundamental joys of magic is it’s an intellectual art form at one level, and as a viewer, you’re trying to reconcile what you see with what you know. The joy of it is going, “That’s impossible! No it can’t be. Yes it is! No it can’t be. Yes it is!” And these two things are colliding—what you see is colliding with what you know. The sparks are coming from this dissonance between what all of your experience tells you and what you’re presently experiencing. The joy of that dissonance is considerable. \n\nBut when you see it on television, you never feel that. “I’m not here in the room, I couldn’t control where my eyes are going.” Part of what *Fool Us* is designed to do is, without saying it, is to say what you’re seeing is really what somebody in the theater is seeing. We do that by focusing on this one silly and trivial aspect of magic, which is, how’s the trick done? We don’t even know what acts are going to be on the show. We’re genuinely trying to see if we can figure out what’s going on. \n\n\n\n__The most interesting part of the show is after each performance, Penn talks in this magician doublespeak to clue in the audience to the trick’s method. How much of this is trying to maintain the secret, and how much is coding to teenagers interested in magic where they can learn these techniques?__\n\nIt’s all of that. When Penn talks about magic, he tries not to spoil the trick for the home audience—that takes away the fun for people who want to watch it over and over again, or people just delighted by the effect. So Penn deliberately uses jargon terms that will communicate to the magician and to the community of magicians that we do know indeed what’s going on, without wrecking the trick for the home audience. \n\nThere also really is, precisely, a way to encourage people who are interested in magic to learn more. If we say, “Does the term ‘breather crimp’ mean anything to you?” That takes somebody who might be really interested in card magic to Google “breather crimp,” and they’re going to learn a really cool thing that they might be able to use.\n\n__Much of magic is now consumed on YouTube. Do you now have to come up with tricks that could withstand multiple replays? Does this change the way you create magic?__\n\nIt sometimes does, and it sometimes doesn’t. For example, the tricks we do on *Fool Us* are generally tricks we’ve done in our live shows. They’re polished enough that they deceive and amaze a live audience. If you rewind it a zillion times and study them out, maybe you could figure out what’s going on here. That doesn’t bother me. I’m just providing more entertainment for you. It’s levels of participation that are now allowed by recording that we didn’t have in former times. If you watch it a zillion times and you go, “I think it happened right there,” that’s a delight for you!\n\n__The sanctity of secrets: Are the secrets as sacrosanct today as they were to a past generation?__\n\nTo some people. I’m mystified by the obsession of popular writers with magic secrets. Everyone who writes about magic should read [author] Jim Steinmeyer’s description of magic secrets. He says the most important secret in magic is that most people believe there’s a safe somewhere that contains all the magic secrets that’s heavily guarded and carefully locked. The biggest secret magicians have to keep is that that safe is empty.\n\n[Related: 72 Hours Inside the Eye-Popping World of Cardistry](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/04/cardistry-con-2015)\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/553676f421478db3485e6130]||||||",
