      "body":"They say that insanity is doing the same summer weekend over and over and expecting a different outcome, but, then again, New Yorkers have never been too concerned with soundness of mind. Despite [a grim 2014 season](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/08/hamptons-problems-summer-rose) of rosé shortages, Kardashian surpluses, celebrity real-estate misadventures, and a recruitment drive by the Ku Klux Klan, wealthy urbanites have again flocked to the Hamptons this summer. \n\nNo surprise here: the beach-lined hamlets continue to be a refuge for havoc. This week’s news that House minority leader __Nancy Pelosi__ [was turned away from a restaurant and kept awake until four A.M.](http://pagesix.com/2015/07/13/hamptons-revelry-keeps-nancy-pelosi-awake-until-4-a-m/) is just the latest in a string of humiliations for visitors and residents alike. We’re not even a month past the summer solstice, but __Madonna__ has already been accused of “stealing” from taxpayers by an East Hampton farmer, on account of her [intention to collect tax credits on a Bridgehampton parcel zoned for commercial-farming use](http://nypost.com/2015/06/28/madonna-accused-of-farm-fraud-as-taxpayer-land-shields-mansion/?_ga=1.148407412.238172599.1375104193). \n\nHarsh vibes have also arrived in Montauk, where Booby Trap MTK had to delay its opening because a “20-year-old vandal bashed in all the windows,” [Page Six reported](http://pagesix.com/2015/06/25/new-montauk-takeout-joint-vandalized-before-opening/). Perhaps Montauk temporary resident __Leonardo DiCaprio__ could class up the joint by taking his 24-year-old girlfriend there for take-out, if they could tear themselves from the daybed where [they reportedly spent all day semi-publicly displaying their affection and drinking rosé](http://pagesix.com/2015/06/11/leo-and-his-new-girlfriend-take-their-makeout-to-montauk/).\n\nWe haven’t forgotten about the rosé shortage—it is back, [and worse than ever](http://pagesix.com/2015/07/02/rose-is-even-scarcer-this-summer-in-the-hamptons/). __Marc Leder,__ the Sun Capital Partners chief known to at least one Page Six writer as “the __Hugh Hefner__ of the Hamptons,” avoided the grape-drink drought by flying in some bottles from Ecuador, though, to be fair, he was already sailing around the Galápagos Islands [when he took receipt of the shipment](http://pagesix.com/2015/06/21/marc-leders-love-boat-narrowly-avoids-rose-shortage/). \n\nIt’s a wonder that all these folks even made it to the Hamptons, with the new helicopter rules and frequent groundings. East Hampton, in April, limited choppers to a single landing per week, infuriating those who could afford to skip sitting on the Long Island Expressway. A court lifted the ban for three weeks, and later ditched the single-landing rule while upholding a curfew of 11 P.M. for helicopters (and 8 P.M. for larger and louder aircraft). \n\n“For months I’ve been talking about helicopters,” The Kills singer __Alison Mosshart__ [griped to Page Six](http://pagesix.com/2015/06/22/mosshart/). “I love them. I want to get on all of them.” Still, at least Mosshart could walk: __Chelsea Leyland,__ a D.J., dislocated her knee at Glastonbury, which [kept her from performing at photographer __Ben Watt’s__ annual Shark Attack Sounds party](http://pagesix.com/2015/07/03/ouch-chelsea-leyland-dislocates-her-knee/). \n\nIf there’s one thing rich people love, it’s blaming populist New York mayor __Bill de Blasio__ for their problems. A Hamptons jitney suffered delays after the mayor’s new traffic-safety plan closed 86th Street and Lexington Avenue to left turns. “We trust reducing the risk a New Yorker is seriously injured or worse is worth a few more minutes on the Jitney,” a [de Blasio aide wrote in response to complaints](http://pagesix.com/2015/06/04/hamptons-bus-line-blames-de-blasio-for-delays/), doubtless prompting exclamations of “The hell it is!” from some Upper East Siders.\n\nEven those who survived the jitney delays faced further frustration upon arrival in East Hampton, where [Uber pulled its service](http://nypost.com/2015/06/07/celebrities-freak-out-after-east-hampton-boots-uber) after new taxi-licensing rules vexed the ever-aggressive start-up. “Its CRAY CRAY better they UBER THAN HAVING DRUNKS ON the ROAD — wake up,” tweeted the wife of one famous person. __Andy Cohen__ agreed.\n\nGrim headlines were everywhere. __Tory Burch__ waited to find out whether she’d [be accepted into the Southampton Bathing Corp](http://pagesix.com/2015/05/16/tory-burch-in-line-for-coveted-spot-at-hamptons-club/). __Elin Nordegren__ [drank shots of sex on the beach](http://pagesix.com/2015/06/15/elin-nordegren-celebrates-single-life-in-the-hamptons/). __Matt Lauer’s__ neighbor [threatened legal action](http://pagesix.com/2015/07/05/matt-lauers-neighbor-stop-blocking-my-view-of-your-farm/) over some view-obstructing trees that Lauer was planting on his farm. __Christie Brinkley’s__ ex-husband __Peter Cook__ [reportedly](http://pagesix.com/2015/07/06/christie-brinkleys-cheating-ex-ogles-every-pretty-young-thing/) ogled “pretty young things” in Sag Harbor, while Christie Brinkley’s ex-husband __Billy Joel__ married __Alexis Roderick__ elsewhere on Long Island. An anonymous 10-year-old Hamptons resident [described himself](http://fashionweekdaily.com/true-life-im-a-rich-kid/) as a “kidult.” \n\nIt wasn’t exactly his choice, but polo player __Nacho Figueras__ ended up with the correct idea, [playing in California](http://pagesix.com/2015/07/05/polo-player-nacho-figueras-wont-be-in-the-hamptons-this-summer/) after the Hamptons polo grounds where he used to earn his keep were sold. Figueras reportedly skipped the Hamptons altogether, decamping for St. Tropez after his stint in the Santa Barbara area. Now that’s how it’s done. ",

And Groundhog Day every day for the journalists, think-tank types, and hangers-on who populated the various hotels surrounding the Palais Coburg hotel—a former Viennese palace made an even more veritable fortress during the nuclear talks—barred even to journalists willing to spend the thousands of dollars a day that a room costs. Before diplomats arrived at the much-discussed deal on July 13, deadlines came and went, fraying the nerves of all attending parties. This is how it happened. \n\nSightings of negotiators were, as usual, rare, and Iran’s foreign minister was so invisible for the first few days that when he did appear in public on July 2, on the balcony of his suite overlooking the plaza where journalists gathered waiting for news—any news—to film a YouTube video message, the cameramen below furiously went into action, and reporters present shouted questions at him. \n\nTo most, it wasn’t fully clear what __Javad Zarif__ was doing, despite the cameras and lights, and my presence on the balcony where I was shooting background footage for NBC News caused a stir. Some Westerners assumed I was conducting an interview—unusual in the middle of sensitive talks. Iran’s hard-line media, however, decided my appearance with the foreign minister and his two deputies had to have a more nefarious meaning. Within hours I was labeled in hard-line Iranian media outlets as a spy, a manipulator of the talks, a J Street operative, an ally of multiple former presidents, and so on.  Such is the state of play in Iranian politics; any excuse to attack the more moderate administration of __President Hassan Rouhani__, and, particularly, his reformist foreign minister. But Zarif’s YouTube video, revealed the following day, pretty much dominated what frustrated journalists could cover. Two days later, a 10-minute appearance by U.S. secretary of state __John Kerry__ outside the hotel, on crutches and in 90-degree heat, where he spoke partly in response to Zarif’s message but didn’t take questions, dominated reports in much the same way.\n\nThe deadline to reach a comprehensive agreement on Iran’s nuclear program between the so-called P5+1 (five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany) and Iran was set after agreeing on a “joint plan of action” in late 2013. That deadline was July *2014*. It was first extended to November 2014, then again to a two-stage deadline—the first for a “framework” deal on March 31, which was missed by only two days, and the second for a final, yes, really-this-time-we-mean-it agreement by June 30, 2015. No one—in the media, in government, or in Iran, where by now cab drivers are familiar with nuclear jargon such as “S.W.U.”—believed that June 30 would be a real deadline. The real deadline for an agreement to be delivered to Congress for their 30-day review would be July 9 at midnight. If that deadline were missed, Congress would have 60, rather than 30, days to decide the merits of the agreement, leaving an extra month for naysayers and Republican presidential candidates to show how very much they oppose __Barack Obama’s__ Chamberlain-ian appeasement of the turbaned leaders of Iran. \n\nThe days dragged on in Vienna, dashing the hopes of Americans who had expected to join their families for the Fourth of July weekend. Perhaps out of sympathy, the Austrian foreign ministry hosted an elaborate Sunday brunch for journalists accredited to the talks, at the foreign ministry building and in the presence of the foreign minister, __Sebastian Kurz__, who at 28 years old was one of the youngest people in the room. \n\nAnd yet on the morning of the seventh, rumors—the currency of a series of talks where virtually no news of the talks themselves leaked—were rife that something was up. An *Iranian* journalist tweeted that Kerry would briefly speak to the press outside the Coburg as he had done a few days prior, on crutches, and Fars, the Tehran-based news agency, repeated the rumor and then retracted it within minutes. Reporters were jittery, both because of the 10 days spent sitting and waiting, the upcoming deadlines, and the endless cups of coffee consumed either gratis in the media tent outside the Coburg, or in the lobby of the Marriott, which during the talks becomes an extension of the tent. There were a number of Iranian officials at the Marriott, as well as a contingent from the University of Tehran, headed by professor __Mohammad Marandi,__ who invited a few leftist Western journalists to join his party. Marandi, known by American reporters from his many appearances on CNN, did not engage the mainstream media much, other than to appear on camera, and by and large neither did his invitees, leading to an awkward Berlin Wall of sorts in the lobby.  \n\nBut by midday on the seventh, with some Iranian delegates—as well as some reporters—being ejected from their rooms at the Marriott, which could not extend their stay, it was slowly becoming apparent that there were issues of disagreement among Iran’s interlocutors. Iran bristled at a conventional arms embargo heretofore not mentioned publicly during this round, and it was clear that July 7 would indeed slip away, just as every other deadline has in the 22 months of negotiations with Iran. At lunchtime, it was confirmed that the deadline would be again extended until July 10. One could detect an inaudible sigh among journalists who had, in the almost two weeks they’d been in Vienna, resorted to writing all sorts of stories unrelated to the talks themselves—including even [one report](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3150157/Iran-nuclear-talks-Brothels-bike-rides-Groundhog-Day.html) on the city’s brothels seeing a boost in business whenever the Iranians came to town, no doubt offending the Iranians who could hardly leave their hotel without being mobbed by journalists and cameramen and were the unlikeliest of johns. \n\nIt wasn’t clear exactly what the holdup was, although based on what officials had said, it could be deduced that the lifting of U.N. sanctions—including the conventional arms contained therein—was one major sticking point while other technical issues also hadn’t been nailed down. The supreme leader of Iran’s troubling red lines on major issues, announced only days before his foreign minister was scheduled to leave for Vienna, had already been semantically explained away. So it was all the more surprising, in some ways, that there were still snags given that the negotiators had had three months since they announced a framework deal in Lausanne to iron out what one might have assumed, clearly incorrectly, were relatively minor issues. \nOn the morning of the ninth, reporters once again gathered outside the Coburg, inside the media tent, and in the lobby of Marriott. The new deadline—if there ever was one—was unclear: midnight Washington time, or earlier, to get the agreement to Congress? By afternoon it was announced as midnight Vienna time—six hours before the actual deadline for the 30-day congressional review—due to the needing of “several hours to package” the agreement. \n\nAt seven P.M.—with some reporters on the verge of nervous breakdowns—Kerry hobbled to a podium outside the Coburg and announced that the nuclear talks were being extended, for the umpteenth time it seemed, for a “few more days.” \n\nGroundhog Day would repeat the following morning. Within a few hours, a “senior Iranian official” gave a background briefing in which he accused the U.S. and other Europeans of bad faith in the negotiations, and of withdrawing a “package” that had been offered to the Iranians. This was after Zarif had tweeted, moments before Kerry spoke—and Zarif’s balcony conveniently overlooked the spot where Kerry delivered his remarks—that “you can’t change horses in the middle of the stream,” referring obliquely to some change in the U.S. position on a comprehensive agreement. And so, heading into the third weekend of talks over Iran’s nuclear program, all that was left was some hope, for reporters and negotiators alike, that the end was near, for as Kerry said in his remarks, “we are not going to sit at the negotiating table forever.” \n\nAs expected, soon thereafter speculation began that the deal would be sealed by Sunday night. John Kerry, after all, would have to return to Washington, surely, to avoid breaking a record for a high U.S. official being in one place outside the country in pursuit of one singular goal. But Sunday came and went, and he seemed perfectly happy in his suite at the Imperial Hotel, away from the action but happy also to drop in from time to time for a meeting or two. There were reports of shouting matches in one of those meetings on Sunday, and of a threat to walk by the European Union chief, __Federica Mogherini__, which elicited an angry  “don’t threaten an Iranian” retort by Zarif and a “nor a Russian” echo by __Sergey Lavrov__, whose role in this series of talks seemed to be very much one of supporting the Iranian side, especially on the tricky issue of the arms embargo against Iran, which the Russians wanted lifted almost as much as the Iranians. Lavrov’s presence alone was enough for journalists and analysts to predict an imminent deal, for as the supermodel of foreign ministers, it was widely assumed that he wouldn’t get out of bed for anything less than a deal.\n\nOf course, Sunday bled into Monday, a couple of foreign ministers left and returned in a matter of hours, Lavrov stayed, and by late in the night it was no longer a secret that a deal had been struck. Some reporters jumped the gun—even President Rouhani’s Twitter account seemed to indicate a done deal until an errant tweet was deleted, then reinstated with the qualifier “if.” The question remaining was only how much sleep everyone would get—none, or just a couple of hours. Things fell into place quickly and by early in the morning of Tuesday, July 14, press conferences, background briefings, and TV appearances had been arranged. The full text of the historic agreement was published online by the Russian foreign ministry and picked up by all media, including Farsi-language media publishing it in English. Obama spoke from the White House, and Rouhani from Pasteur Avenue in Tehran, while elsewhere in Iran there was great relief among a population that had virtually held its breath for the past 24 hours, if not 36 years of enmity between Iran and the United States. That figurative exhale was an expression of hope that finally, and permanently, Iranians could see their country thrive among the family of nations, welcomed from the cold into the community.\n\nBut despite the vast worldwide relief that a deal, or an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program has been finally reached, as Yogi Berra once intimated, we will be subject to more déjà vu, if not Groundhog Days, until *everything* is settled—meaning the U.S. is able to sign, and sanctions on Iran are lifted on the schedule it expects—and the discussion of the merits of the deal by the politicians, the media, and heaven forbid, the dealmakers themselves, is over. With a presidential election in the U.S. less than 18 months away and debates among candidates beginning in the fall, chances are good the saga will continue. ",

      "body":"Back on July 13, 1990, just like today, the multiplexes were thick with sequels and action flicks. That day, *Ghost*, starring Patrick Swayze as Sam Wheat, a murdered banker who haunts lower Manhattan to protect his lover Molly Jensen, played by __Demi Moore,__ began its ascent to surprise summer blockbuster. The two-hour supernatural romance, produced on a $22 million budget, grossed more than half a billion worldwide and dramatically out-performed both __Arnold Schwarzenegger’s__ *Total Recall* ($261,317,921) and __Bruce Willis’s__ *Die Hard 2: Die Harder* ($240,031,094). The sleeper hit even toppled the year’s box-office darling, *Pretty Woman*, by almost $50 million as it launched key players into Hollywood’s stratosphere. \n\nAn ethereal Moore—in addition to besting her then-husband Willis—soon became the highest-paid actress. Swayze, fresh off *Dirty Dancing*, further cemented his status as a go-to leading man. The movie’s five Academy Award nominations, including for best picture, netted two Oscars. __Whoopi Goldberg’s__ best-supporting-actress win for her tart portrayal of con-artist psychic Oda Mae Brown ended a 50-year drought for African-American women in the category. (Hattie McDaniel had won for 1939’s *Gone with the Wind*.) Presenter __Jodie Foster__ gave the film’s second statuette to __Bruce Joel Rubin,__ *Ghost*’s screenwriter, who defeated __Woody Allen__ (*Alice*). \n\nWhen the *Los Angeles Times* featured photos from the ceremony “there was Jodie Foster, __Anthony Hopkins,__ and my right arm,” says Rubin, whose other credits include *Jacob’s Ladder* and *The Time Traveler’s Wife*. “That’s what it is to be a writer in Hollywood.” We asked Rubin to share memories of making the beloved film to mark its silver anniversary.\n\n__How turning on, tuning in, and dropping out led to Tinseltown success.__\n\n*Ghost*’s journey from idea to screen began in 1965 with “an LSD trip,” says Rubin. A roommate—who knew counter-culture guru Timothy Leary—gave Rubin a tablet of LSD that he secreted away and waited “for the right time to take.” When that moment finally arrived, “nothing happened.” This being the 60s, a visitor had just stowed a vial of pure Sandoz acid in Rubin’s refrigerator. “My roommate went to give me one drop,” says Rubin. “He went, ‘Whoops!’ The entire eyedropper went shooting down my throat and I began a journey that has never ended.” Rubin realized he wanted to tell an “entertaining and not pontifical” story from a ghost’s point of view. Two years of pitching around Hollywood culminated in one trippy week that saw five studios vying for the idea.\n\n> The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY JENSEN,\n> in her late 20’s, has a bandanna around her hair and a workman’s mask\n> over her nose, but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she\n> is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his late 30’s, is also hidden behind a\n> mask, but he has a strong forehead and handsome features. — *Ghost*\n> screenplay\n\n**Demi’s pixie haircut and snagging Swayze.**\t\t\t       \t\t\t     \n\nAfter the project landed at Paramount, studio executive __Lindsay Doran__ called Rubin to say she had found a director. “My heart was beating through my chest and I’m thinking, __Spielberg, Scorsese,__ then she said, ‘__Jerry Zucker.__’” At the time, Zucker was known for wacky comedies like the cult hit *Airplane!*. “I thought [he] was probably the worst choice.” Still, Rubin agreed to a dinner where “a great friendship formed. [Zucker’s] one of the most extraordinarily wonderful people around.” A year of collaborating on somewhat painful re-writes of re-writes yielded a script that was “crisper.”\n\nNext came the “delicious” casting process. “Demi was on the radar immediately. And she wanted to do it, which was wonderful,” says Rubin, who calls her “ballsy.” Moore was hired “as a long-haired actress,” but showed up on the first day of shooting with “a short haircut, which is kind of an in-your-face choice,” Rubin recalls. “It announced to us that she had her own ideas about who her character was.” In addition to Moore’s “stunning haircut,” Rubin praises the actress’s “depth of emotionality. She can literally produce tears from one eye or the other.”\n\nFor the part of Sam, the filmmakers “went to every major actor in Hollywood who was hot at the time.” So who turned the part down? “Everybody. __Harrison Ford__ said, ‘I read this thing three times and I still don’t get it.’ __Michael J. Fox, Paul Hogan,__ on and on, we kept getting turned down.” Rubin believes the actors “didn’t want to play dead men . . . they all saw it as a loss of vitality.” Zucker had faith the film would land somebody better after each pass but “finally there wasn’t anybody. . . . When Patrick said yes, he basically saved the movie.”\n\n> **INT. MOLLY'S STUDIO — NIGHT**\n> Molly, dressed only in a T-shirt, is\n> sitting at her potter’s wheel throwing a series of pots. Sam enters\n> the studio. He is barefoot, shirtless, wearing jeans. — *Ghost*\n> screenplay\n\n__Somewhere in the Paramount vault is an unseen Swayze-Moore sex scene.__\n\nRubin’s wife is a potter, and it was Zucker’s idea to make Moore’s character one, too. The equal-parts hot and artsy scene between Moore and Swayze—where his hands envelop hers in wet clay as she spins a phallic pot between her legs—has become iconic in the annals of celluloid romance. Initially, though, the scene’s carnal nature “was not something that we were prepared for. In fact, we shot a lovemaking scene.” Yet as everyone watched the pottery-scene dailies—the screening of footage shot the previous day—“we just kind of looked at each other and started to understand that what we had was really amazing. The pottery scene proved to be so erotic that we didn’t need anything else.” And while the statistics on a presumed spike in pottery wheels is unknown, the song that accompanies the scene, 1965’s *Unchained Melody* by The Righteous Brothers, quickly reappeared on the Billboard charts.\n\n__The beginning of a beautiful GIF.__\n\nZucker asked Rubin to create “a *Casablanca* line” and the two came up with Swayze’s final dialogue: “The love inside, you take it with you.” Yet the oft-quoted dialogue that has become an [Internet GIF sensation](http://giphy.com/gifs/1990s-you-in-danger-girl-oda-mae-brown-ud860a84pr5Ic) occurs when Goldberg, acting as the medium between Swayze and Moore, warns, “Molly, you in danger, girl.” (Sam’s murderer, Carl Bruner, played by __Tony Goldwyn,__ poses the danger in question.) Though Rubin cannot recall the remark’s exact providence, he guesses “it was Whoopi because she is unbelievably funny.” The TV smash *Scandal*, currently starring Goldwyn, appropriated the line for a tongue-in-cheek [episode title](http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/scandal-molly-you-in-danger-girl-95920).\n\n__*Ghost* also haunted the box office.__\n\nOn opening weekend, 25 years ago, Zucker called Rubin and told him *Ghost* had “sold out everywhere.“ The movie continued to vie for the top slot at the box office through mid-September. ”And we were still playing in theaters six months later at Christmas,” Rubin says.  \n\n> __MOLLY__ I love you. I really love you.\n> \n> He smiles and strokes her cheek.\n> \n> __SAM__ Ditto.  \n> — *Ghost* screenplay\n\n__Twenty-five years, a Japanese remake, and a Broadway musical later . . .__ \n\nRubin credits the secret of *Ghost*’s success to the idea of a dead guy learning to say “I love you” to someone he failed to say it to when he was alive. “That you would fight back from the other side is a core wish of people. [The film] postulates a universe . . . where love goes on.” The writer says he used “a very simple line at the end” to convey this cosmic idea, one Moore says—as a tear wells in her right eye—after she and Swayze share a final kiss: ”See ya.“",

      "body":"On Tuesday morning, the city comptroller for New York City announced a $5.9 million payout for the wrongful death of __Eric Garner,__ whose homicide was captured on camera and accelerated the already heated civil-rights debate over the relationship between police and minority communities.\n \n[*The New York Times* reports](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/nyregion/eric-garner-case-is-settled-by-new-york-city-for-5-9-million.html) that the settlement, one of the largest civil-rights claims ever paid out by the N.Y.P.D., would end the lawsuit that Garner’s family filed against the city. (The family, which initially filed a $75 million suit, reportedly [turned down](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/eric-garner-widow-rejects-city-5m-settlement-source-article-1.2290081) an initial $5 million settlement days ago.)\n \n“Financial compensation is certainly not everything, and it can’t bring Mr. Garner back,” comptroller __Scott M. Stringer__ told the *Times.* “But it is our way of creating balance and giving a family a certain closure.”\n \nFriday marks the one-year anniversary of Garner’s death at the hands of police officer __Daniel Pantaleo__, who was filmed gripping Garner in a chokehold during his arrest for selling untaxed cigarettes on the street. Pantaleo’s non-indictment sparked massive protests throughout New York City for weeks, deepening the gulf between the N.Y.P.D. and __Mayor Bill de Blasio__ and leading to nationwide calls for police reform\n\nThough the family’s lawsuit against the city has ended, Garner’s death is still the subject of multiple inquries, and the cops involved could still face federal charges. \n",

      "body":"Brace yourselves, people who dress as Disney characters at Disney World, and . . . people who man the roller coasters at Disney World, and, uh, everyone else in Orlando. __Prince Harry__ is coming.\n \nThe palace announced Tuesday that Harry [will be taking](http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/prince-harry-brings-invictus-games-to-america--2015147) his Invictus Games to Florida, for the second iteration of the event—in which wounded servicemen, from around the world, compete in a range of sporting events—after the inaugural games in September of 2014, in London. (Per *Us Weekly*, those games involved 400 participants from 13 different countries.)\n \nHarry said, in a statement, “As I've continued to work with wounded servicemen and women, I regularly see the power of the soldiers' stories to inspire others. For every competitor last September, there are hundreds of others around the world who would benefit from having the same opportunity. I wanted other cities and countries to look at the competition—what it meant to those taking part and those who saw it—and take up the challenge for the next Invictus Games. I am absolutely delighted that the United States has taken up that challenge and will host the next Invictus Games in 2016. I have no doubt that the USA will set the bar even higher than London did and put on a great show.”\n \nHarry has been on the move quite a bit the past few months. He spent about a month Down Under this spring, missing the birth of __Princess Charlotte__ while he finished out his time with the armed services. And he has just departed for Africa, where he’ll be spending three months this summer focusing on the conservation of rhinos and elephants (he was forced to miss Charlotte’s christening, as he had already arrived in Africa). But could Harry get a photo op with a twentysomething dressed as Cinderella—to be captioned across the Internet with some variation of “Prince Meets Princess”—in either of those places, as he’ll be able to in Orlando? Certainly not.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/559e8d989e9755183d96e06f]||||||\n\n\n",
