  "dek":"Mike Nichols, who [died at home in New York last November 19](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/11/mike-nichols-obituary), 13 days past his 83rd birthday, left a crater-size hole in the cultural landscape and in the life of the city he loved. He was that rare thing—a success in entertainment for six decades, beginning in the late 1950s with the classic comedy albums he made with the brilliant Elaine May (which had first been developed into a Broadway stage show, *An Evening with Nichols and May,* directed by Arthur Penn), then becoming one of the leading theater and motion-picture directors of the second half of the last century. He directed such landmark films as *The Graduate, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Carnal Knowledge,* and *Silkwood,* as well as 22 Broadway plays, including the 2012 revival of *Death of a Salesman,* starring the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Nichols is one of only 12 people to have won an Emmy (for best director of a television play and mini-series, for *Wit* and *Angels in America*), a Grammy (for best comedy album, with Elaine May, in 1962), an Oscar (for best director, for *The Graduate*), and a Tony (nine in all).",
