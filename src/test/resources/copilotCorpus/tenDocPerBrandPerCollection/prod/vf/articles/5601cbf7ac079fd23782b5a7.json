  "body":"__Nicolas Winding Refn__ has always been a collector, but he never intended to wind up with a thousand posters for movies that largely no longer exist. And yet, there he was in Copenhagen, __Ryan Gosling__ by his side, combing through a trove of movie posters culled from the Times Square exploitation theaters in the 70s and 80s, with titles like *She Freak* and *Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die.*\n\n“It was like going into a time machine, like a time capsule,” Refn says of the collection, sent to him by friend and journalist [Jimmy McDonough](https://lareviewofbooks.org/interview/ball-of-fire-an-interview-with-jimmy-mcdonough#). “To do something useful for this, I want to do a poster book, and I want to do the most expensive poster book ever produced.”\n\nAnd thus we have *Nicolas Winding Refn: The Act of Seeing*, a collection of more than 300 of these posters, coming October 5 from FAB Press. Each poster is accompanied by historical detail about the film, many of which are no longer available for anyone to see. Refn, like most of the readers of the book, only knows about the films from the alluring posters themselves—“I’m not a film expert, I’m not a walking encyclopedia of film, so I didn’t know any of the movies really.” \n\nBut that mystery, for the director of *Drive* and *Only God Forgives*, is part of the appeal. “I’m not really interested in the films themselves, I’m interested in the illusion they would represent,” he says. “I’m interested in what it would be like walking down the street in heyday of cinema, when there was a cinema next to a cinema next to a cinema, all promising the fulfillment of dreams.”\n\nRefn still has all of the original posters in storage—his wife would only allow one of them, [*Captive Wild Woman*](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/movieposters/40086/p40086_p_v7_aa.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/movieposters/40086/p40086_p_v7_aa.jpg&h=720&w=480&tbnid=mt0D41FNlFZdJM:&tbnh=160&tbnw=106&usg=__XpPHpb9YARkZRqYajoc0bKINrlU=&docid=K1cffu_DRiGcyM&itg=1), to hang in their home—and, as far as Refn knows, Gosling didn’t pilfer one to hang in his own house. But keeping the posters out of sight might be the best way to honor their purpose. After all, Refn, says, “Cinema is not really about what you see, it’s what you don’t see.”",
