  "body":"Amazon Studios [has announced its new slate of pilots](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2089832), which will be made available for free on Amazon and will receive feedback from the audience, all in the hopes of receiving a series order. There are a lot of interesting-sounding shows in the mix, including an intense western from __Shane Black,__ a show based on __Tig Notaro’s__ life co-created by __Diablo Cody__ and directed by __Nicole Holofcener,__ and a pilot starring __Christina Ricci__ as Zelda Fitzgerald. It’s quite a lineup! But, nothing intrigues us more than this little clause in one of the show descriptions:\n\n“and __Grace Gummer__ as Nora Ephron.” \n\nThat comes toward the end of the section about a pilot called *Good Girls Revolt*, which is based on the book *The Good Girls Revolt*, about a group of female *Newsweek* employees who sued the magazine for sexual harassment in 1970. The late, great Ephron was one of those women, and now Grace Gummer, daughter of __Meryl Streep,__ will be playing her in a television pilot. \n\nWhich feels just about perfect, doesn’t it? Considering Streep and Ephron’s fruitful working relationship and all. Of course there was *Julie & Julia*, but before that there was *Heartburn*, in which Streep essentially played a slightly altered version of Ephron. So basically mother and daughter will have played the same woman at two different points in her life. Which is fascinating! Here’s hoping that this is one of the lucky pilots that gets picked up. And not just for the Gummer-as-Ephron factor, either. The premise is great, as is the fact that the cast also includes the wonderful __Anna Camp__ and dreamy dreamy dream-machine __Hunter Parrish.__\n\nBeyond that, we’re pretty psyched to see what Ricci can do as mad Zelda, and probably won’t mind __Ryan Kwanten__ dressed up in cowboy gear for the Shane Black western. All told, plenty of promising things coming from Amazon! Who said there was too much TV?\n",
