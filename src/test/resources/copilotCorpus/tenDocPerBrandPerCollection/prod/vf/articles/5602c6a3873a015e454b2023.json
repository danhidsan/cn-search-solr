  "body":"Carly Fiorina is being congratulated throughout the land for not only [“winning” the CNN debate last week](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/09/carly-fiorina-donald-trump-gop-debate), but doing it in three-and-a-half-inch heels. Quite an accomplishment, if she says so herself, which she does: “It was a long debate, and I’ll tell you what, I had to do it in high heels.” I couldn’t do it, and nor could any of the men running against her. Though a high-heeled-shoe race would be a nice break from all these debates. I put my money on Jeb.\n \nBut why is it necessary for a presidential candidate to prove her worth by imitating the ancient Chinese practice of foot-binding? Partly, I suppose, it is to make herself seem taller. History shows that in American presidential politics, the taller candidate usually wins. There are obvious evolutionary reasons for this, and they will not be easily overcome. But they can be overcome, and probably will be some day. The one time I met Margaret Thatcher, she turned out to be unbelievably short. That, clearly, didn’t stop her. Golda Meir was no long drink of water. But height can’t be the only consideration. Arianna Huffington, who lacks not for height, is quoted on her own website, Huffingtonpost.com, saying that she owns a pair of the same shoes Carly wore and loves them. And yet she retains her balance, both politically and physically. It is clearly important to Fiorina to look “put together” and it’s nice (he said hypocritically) that no one is making a fuss over the fact that the brand of shoe she was wearing (they were Monolo Blahniks) seem to cost more than $600 at Nordstrom’s. To be fair, you do get two of them for that.\n\nShoes are only one way that the half-finished feminist revolution has left women at an unfair disadvantage. How long do you suppose Fiorina spent with her makeup, her hair, her clothes, her shoes, and so on, the night of the debate, compared to, say, Rand Paul? A good guess would be at least an hour for her, and about ten minutes for him—and ten minutes only because it was a special occasion.\n     \nWomen running for office—or even women who are just working in an office—are still expected to dress nicely, and even with a bit of flair, while more than a bit of flair would be regarded as highly suspicious in a man running for president. (Just watch the famous [John Edwards “I Feel Pretty” video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kCAFkfFLQQ) on YouTube.) The feminist revolution liberated women from many artificial constraints to success, but it left this one intact. Women with ambition are still supposed to dress as if it was 1960. So are men, but in 1960 it didn’t take them much longer than it does today. In fact, history has been simplifying men’s wardrobes ever since spats disappeared around the turn of the century. Cufflinks are gone, tie clips likewise. The business suit itself is on its way out, everyplace in the country except perhaps, for Washington and New York. Casual Friday has quickly evolved into casual everyday, but this development has still been better for men than for women, who must have a “casual” wardrobe that is something more than just pressed jeans and a reasonably clean polo shirt if they want to climb the corporate or political ladder. Even in Silicon Valley, where you can wear shorts to work, I’ll bet the women—certainly the women executives—must “lean forward” sartorially. (When I worked at Microsoft, after working at CNN, I used to say that I’d gone from a company where the men wore makeup to a company where the women didn’t, but the second part wasn’t really true.) If you figure, conservatively, that Carly Fiorina spends an extra 15 minutes a day on putting herself together that John Kasich doesn’t have to, that’s almost two hours a week, or 20 ten-hour days. It’s like subtracting an entire month between now and election day. That’s a month Kasich can use to study the issues, or to run the state of Ohio, or just to sleep. Maybe this is an injustice to Kasich, who may spend hours a day to achieve that crazed-dog look. (But he had an additional 169 minutes to sleep during the three-hour debate.)\n\nThis is a problem that won’t go away anytime soon. Meanwhile, Carly has thrown down the gauntlet to her fellow Republican candidates: Walk a mile in her shoes.",
