  "body":"At the altar end of the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington there’s a round emblem set into the marble floor, the size of the tip-off circle in a junior-high-school gym. It reads: “Here rested the remains of President Kennedy, at the Requiem Mass, November 25, 1963, before their removal to Arlington, where they lie in expectation of a heavenly resurrection.”\n \nAfter his meeting with __President Obama__ at the White House this morning __Pope Francis__ will proceed to St. Matthew’s to address the U.S. Catholic bishops. The cathedral event is one of the few events of Francis’s United States visit that was closed to the media, and it was the one least burdened with symbolism. But the location—the site where one dark day the American story and the Catholic story converged once and for all—makes it, in a sense, the most symbolically rich event of the trip. Here’s why. Come December, Francis will have spent a thousand days as Pope (today is day 924); and his thousand days—vibrant, rich in surprises, consequential out of proportion to specific acts or policies—call to mind the “thousand days” of the Kennedy administration, a theme Kennedy introduced at his inaugural and his aide Arthur Schlesinger burnished into legend. \n\n__[Related: Can Pope Francis Really Get His Message Through in the U.S.?](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/09/can-pope-francis-get-his-message-through-in-the-us)__\n \nI went to St. Matthew’s yesterday for eight A.M. mass. As cathedrals go, it’s nothing special from the outside, a reddish stone and brick-wedged midblock on Rhode Island Avenue. Fifty people were inside, including the priest and the sound man. Twenty-three minutes later the mass was ended. As I poked around the church afterward I noted plenty of details that put the papal visit in mind. There’s a bust of a square-jawed __John Paul II__ to mark his visit to the place in 1979 and a stone blessed by __Benedict XVI__ to mark his visit to the capital in 2008. And off to the right is a chapel modeled on the one in Padua, in Italy, devoted to St. Anthony, a beloved thirteenth-century Franciscan friar. There’s a fresco of the Pope’s namesake, St. Francis of Assisi, and an etched translation of Francis’s “Canticle of the Sun”—the hymn of praise to God and creation from which Pope Francis took the title of *Laudato Si’*, his recent encyclical letter on the environment.\n \nFrancis-friendly, feature-ready stuff—but as I left the cathedral it was the “thousand days” theme that stuck in the mind, something like the way for Schlesinger “the roll of the drums, when we walked over to St. Matthew’s Cathedral on the frosty Monday, will sound forever in my ears.”\n \nKennedy introduced the thousand-days theme as he stated his aims in his inaugural address in January 1961: “All this will not be finished in the first hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, not even perhaps in our life on this planet. But let us begin.” A thousand days later, his remains rested at the head of the aisle in St. Matthew’s; a year and a half after that, Schlesinger brought out *A Thousand Days*, his chronicle of the Kennedy administration. A close aide to Kennedy, Schlesinger was first of all a Pulitzer Prize–winning historian, and his summation of the Kennedy effect at the very end of a very long book was a rhetorical moon shot: \n \n\n> “He had had so little time. . . . Yet he had accomplished so much: the\n> new hope for peace on earth, the elimination of nuclear testing in the\n> atmosphere and the abolition of nuclear diplomacy, the new policies\n> toward Latin America and the third world, the reordering of American\n> defense, the emancipation of the American Negro, the revolution in\n> national economic policy, the concern for poverty, the stimulus to the\n> arts, the fight for reason against extremism and mythology.”\n\n \nFrancis, too, has accomplished much in little time: the demythologizing of the papacy, the apportioning of Vatican decision-making with a kitchen cabinet, the reform of the Curia, the opening of the Vatican Bank to scrutiny, and the disciplining of bishops who turned a blind eye to priestly sexual abuse; the end of the U.S. standoff with Cuba and the denunciation of economic models that prize inequality and threaten the earth; the recovery of Catholic love for poor people, the opening to gay people and divorced people, the dialogue with people who expressly reject religion, the embodiment of the Church’s future in the Americas and the global South, and the confident affirmation that the Catholic Church, for all its sins, has at many times in many places been a force for good.  \n \nLike the Kennedy effect, the Francis effect involves mood and spirit as well as achievement. It’s symbolic. “Lifting us beyond our capacities,” Schlesinger wrote, “he gave his country back to its best self, wiping away the world’s impression of an old nation of old men, weary, played out, fearful of ideas, change and the future; he taught mankind that the process of rediscovering America was not over.” Substitute “Church” for “country” and “Catholicism” for “America” and you have the Francis effect in a few words.  \n \nTo liken Jorge Mario Bergoglio to John F. Kennedy leaves a lot out. It passes over the fact that John Paul II transfixed American Catholics with his charisma and capacity for action—and his chiseled profile—when he visited the United States in 1979. It scants the efforts of Benedict XVI, who set the groundwork for the curial and bank reforms Francis has carried out—and whose retirement demystified the papacy profoundly. And it passes over the fact that Francis’s pontificate is still in progress. Oddly, the televised imagery from Pope Francis’s arrival Tuesday at Joint Base Andrews—formerly Andrews Air Force Base—recalled the footage of the arrival of Kennedy’s body from Dallas in November 1963: the plane idling on the tarmac, the phalanx of black cars, the blow-by-blow commentary, the admirers watching the motorcade from grassy knolls. But this Pope is alive, and we can hope his pontificate has a ways to go.        \n \nFrancis’s thousand days: that is the era the Catholic Church is in just now. To be a Catholic and to be in the capital while Francis is here is to know what it must have felt like when John F. Kennedy was in the White House—to feel that (as Schlesinger put it) “the energies he released, the standards he set, the purposes he inspired, the goals he established would guide the land he loved for years to come.”     \n\n__[Related: How Pope Francis Became the People’s Pontiff](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/09/pope-francis-usa-tour)__ \n \n*Paul Elie, a senior fellow in Georgetown’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, is the author of* The Life You Save May Be Your Own *and* Reinventing Bach. *In 2014, on the 25th anniversary of the publication of* The Satanic Verses, *Elie [wrote about author](http://www.vanityfair.com/unchanged/2014/05/salman-rushdie-ian-mcwean-martin-amis-satanic-verses-fatwa) Salman Rushdie and the controversy surrounding the novel.

      "dek":"\nOn Wednesday, Catholic cardinals in Vatican City ended their 2013 search for the Next Top Catholic by electing Jorge Mario Bergoglio from Argentina as [the world’s 266th pope](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/03/new-pope-francis-south-america-angentina-vatican). Bergoglio, who will go by Francis, greeted his following while wearing traditional white vestments, an austere crucifix, and understated glasses on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica—a sartorial tabula rasa for the vintage accessories and bold-colored papal attire that may be to come. Because, as tradition-bound as the Catholic Church is, its leaders have historically exhibited a daring sense of style over their 2,000 years in the high office. (What other men outside the rap community can get away with red slippers, fur-trimmed caplets, ruby bling, white skullcaps, and engraved chalices?) In anticipation of Pope Francis defining his personal papal style, we look back at some of the highlights in pontiff fashion—the jaunty headware, flamboyant footwear, and designer eyewear that have separated the Carrie Bradshaws of Catholic leaders (Benedict XVI) from the Mirandas (John Paul II).\n\n",

While the mozzetta has been depicted in portraits of the pope since at least the 14th century, John Paul II—who, preferring cleaner lines, was the Calvin Klein of Catholic leaders—buried it in the back of the papal closet before you-know-who (Benedict XVI) revived the style.\n \n\n",

Benedict XVI once tried to pull off this look during a 2005 St. Peter’s Square appearance. When he received criticism from both the fashion and eyesight-capable communities—he was cruelly called “Santa Pope” and narrowly avoided appearing in *Us Weekly’*s “What Not to Wear” column—the pope made like a million excuses for the hat and vowed never to wear it again. “I was just cold, and I happen to have a sensitive head,” he was quoted as saying. “And I said, since the camauro is there [in the closet], let’s put it on. But I was really just trying to fight off the cold.” Sure, sure.\n \n\n",

A new ring is cast in gold for each pope and, in the past, was extravagantly destroyed in Thor-like fashion with a silver hammer at the end of his term. (Recognizing that this seems extreme, the Church now just scratches a cross-shaped mark into the ring.) Pope Pius IX, apparently the Paris Hilton of pontiffs, eschewed tradition by reportedly wearing a cameo of himself constructed almost entirely out of tiny diamonds. While it is rare for popes to wear self-portrait signets, it is not uncommon for popes to wear additional ecclesiastical rings set with stones—more ornate depending on the fashion of the era—and pectoral crosses affixed with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.\n \n\n",

The three-tiered style (“triregnum”) has many symbolic interpretations and for centuries was most famously exhibited during the traditionally *six-hour-long* coronation ceremonies. Because they are usually constructed from silver and enriched with, on some occasions, hundreds of jewels, the elaborate neck-straining devices can weigh upwards of 10 pounds. In somewhat fitting tiara trivia, the heaviest papal headpiece was provided by Napoleon, supposed inferiority-complex sufferer, who gifted Pope Pius VII an 18-pound crown. As an added bonus, the triregnum can be melted down for [ransom money in emergency situations](http://www.antiques-art-collectibles.com/jewelry/crownjewels/papal.html) and used as an easy conversation starter in literally every situation imaginable.
