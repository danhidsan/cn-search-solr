  "body":"__Update (5:18 P.M.):__  Since this post originally went up, we have uncovered  Richard E. Grant’s  mysterious Season 6 role and how it relates to Davis’s. That info has been added to the post below. \n\n\nAnother day another bit of *Game of Thrones* casting news! This time, the news involves Australian actress __Essie Davis__ star of the 2014 horror film *The Babadook*. In that film, Davis played the mother of an unruly son who was forced to come to terms with her demons. Definitely sounds like a certain Westerosi queen we all love to hate. Davis will, in fact, be playing a version of Cersei Lannister. For more on her role, photos of her in costume, and an explanation of how she’s connected to __Richard E. Grant__, check out the info below the spoiler warning. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/557d9e66ca2dc24e4d26975b]||||||\n\nDavis has taken the part of “Leading Actress,” a role that was described in the [casting call](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/game-of-thrones-season-6-casting-greyjoys-tarlys) as being “in her early 40s, she’s an elegant actress with a traveling theatre company. Fun, charismatic, rum-drinking actress in the troupe.” The troupe of actors who will appear in Season 6 are playing out a book plot described in a released chapter from the upcoming “A Song of Ice and Fire” novel, *The Winds of Winter*. The troupe will put on a show called “The Bloody Hand” about the events that have happened at King’s Landing over the past few seasons. You can see this [fan-captured video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F34KaOQSNsI) footage of some of the players, including Davis, in action. That’s right, *Game of Thrones* is about to get meta. Here’s a better look of Davis in costume.  \n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/lady_sati/status/642413261892268032]\n\nAnd every good leading actress needs a leading actor. Richard E. Grant, whose role has remained a mystery since it was [announced several days ago](http://watchersonthewall.com/richard-e-grant-joining-the-cast-of-game-of-thrones/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=socialnetwork), will play the leader of the troupe. You can see him in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F34KaOQSNsI) in costume as King Robert and also in this [set image](http://watchersonthewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Grant-x-2.jpg) looking much more like himself. His character is [described](http://watchersonthewall.com/richard-e-grants-game-of-thrones-role-revealed/) as the “larger-than-life leader of a troupe of actors” who “specializes in portraying drunken aristocrats.” Anyone who knows Grant’s work knows he’s perfect for the role. \n\n[#image: /photos/55f34823fad0d98d444d116f]||||||\n\nThe *Game of Thrones*–community site [Watchers on the Wall](http://watchersonthewall.com/essie-davis-joins-the-cast-of-game-of-thrones/) broke both the news of Davis’s casting and Grant’s role and has a further [rundown](http://watchersonthewall.com/game-of-thrones-gets-theatrical-plus-massive-spoilers-for-season-six/) of the performers in the acting troupe, though none are as well-known as Davis and Grant. The biggest takeaway of that rundown for book readers is that Arya won’t be involved with the troupe in their earlier scenes. In the book, Arya plays the role of her sister, Sansa, who in this play, alas, gets raped and murdered by her dwarf husband. (Oh yes, the troupe takes some liberties with the truth.) But eagle-eyed fans have spotted actress __Eline Powell__ on set in Sansa’s signature red wig so at least we won’t have to endure another Stark girl getting raped. Probably. \n\nBut we do know Arya will eventually join the troupe because here she is alongside Davis. \n\n\n[#instagram: https://instagram.com/p/7ekzcNyjwp/]\n\n\n\n\n\nOther characters in this King’s Landing drama include Tyrion, Margaery, King Robert, and King Joffrey. Looks like [flashbacks](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/07/game-of-thrones-bran-visions-jon-snow) won’t be the only way we’ll revisit the dead in Season 6. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
