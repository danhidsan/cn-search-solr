  "body":"Jackie Collins’s self-designed mansion—with its Hockney-esque swimming pool, its staircase out of *Sunset Boulevard,* and 11 silver and bronze leopards lying about the living room—is located in Beverly Hills. But like her writing, it’s really all about Hollywood\n\nThe electric eye of the video camera outside the Beverly Hills home of Jackie Collins, the Proust of Hollywood, eyed me suspiciously. The intercom buzzed, and the gates swung open into the forecourt of the white modernist house shimmering in the sunlight. A security guard was on patrol, a gun clipped inside the back pocket of his jeans like a fat wallet.\n\n“Ever used it?” I asked.\n\n“Not yet.”\n\nThen Jackie Collins appeared at the imposing front door, preceded by what I took to be an attack dog. It was going for my crotch as the security man hauled him off. “Welcome to Hollywood!” said Jackie, beaming.\n\nAnd Hollywood, of course, is her business. The famous author—famous enough for a busload of Japanese tourists to pause outside her home as if paying respects to a Hollywood shrine— has sold a phenomenal 180 million copies of her books, which “throb with the jungle beat of mating,” in 40 countries. Of late, seven of her best-sellers have been published in Russia, making her more popular, perhaps, than Tolstoy. “Well,” she said when I mentioned it, “I wouldn’t put it that way myself.”\n\nShe’s teasable and fun, feline, smart, good company, self-deprecating in the English manner. “Small isn’t it, dear?” she said of the gigantic marble entryway, which rises 60 feet to the skylights. The staircase in *Sunset Boulevard* looks a bit cramped compared with hers. At the same time, she’s surprisingly homey, even cozy, though one thinks, Don’t mess with Jackie. She was wearing black kneehigh boots, a black suit, and many silver crosses: the Dominatrix Look. Her trademark Leopard Look was absent that day. “It’s on the cushions,” she explained cheerfully.\n\nIn addition to the somewhat intimidating leopard paintings, leopards are everywhere else in the house, like totems. Eleven bronze and silver leopard sculptures are in the sitting room. “I don’t live the Hollywood lifestyle,” she said. “I move in it. I’m an observer.” By coincidence, my handy little *Encyclopedia of Traditional Symbols* describes the mythic, intrepid leopard as “the Great Watcher.”\n\n\nNobody is a better student of Hollywood life than Jackie the Great Watcher! Before she took me on a tour of her new home, we talked in the library, where, among two exquisite Biedermeier desks, various Buddhas, and many family photos in silver frames, there is a leather-bound collection of all her original manuscripts. Perhaps they’ll be left to Harvard someday. “*Exactly!*” she said. They’re handwritten on legal pads—she doesn’t type— and, on occasion, the spelling is a little shaky, not that she gives a damn. At random, she read this aloud from the opening of *Hollywood Wives:*\n\n“Elaine Conti awoke in her luxurious bed in her luxurious Beverly Hills mansion”—“You see,” Jackie Collins exclaimed and laughed, “that’s *very* Hollywood”—“pressed a button to open the electrically controlled drapes, and was confronted with the sight of a young man clad in a white T-shirt and dirty jeans pissing a perfect arc into the luxurious mosaic-tiled swimming pool . . .”\n\n“That’s a *true* incident,” she said of the customary revenge of the young proletariat on Hollywood wealth. May it never happen to her pool. Then she read the opening words of *Hollywood Husbands,* giggling happily:\n\n“Jack Python walked through the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel with every eye upon him. He had money, charisma, a certain kind of power, razor-sharp wit, and fame. It all showed.”\n\nThe hero Python, like Jackie Collins, fulfills the aphorism of Gore Vidal: “Nobody is allowed to fail within a two-mile radius of the Beverly Hills Hotel.” But the line “It all showed” is key. “It’s *got* to show in Hollywood,” she said. “Image is everything.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nShe reverses the rules for herself. For instance, according to the mad, rigid rules and symbols of Hollywood success, she shouldn’t have greeted me at the door. Staff greets first. Nor—sacrilege!—should she have made me a cup of tea. “A maid should have served it on a silver tray!” she explained. These things are difficult to believe, but because she does not observe the rules of Hollywood royalty, her image within the community is that of an English eccentric who dances to her own tune.\n\n“Cars are very important,” she added. She has three: a Jeep, a 1960s Mustang, and a Mercedes. But they’re the wrong image. “If this were a *real* Hollywood home there would be a black Bentley and a white Porsche, probably with ‘His’ and ‘Hers’ license plates. Or two personalized plates I’ve actually seen—HE MAKES, SHE SPENDS. There would also be a third car, a Camaro, for the 16-year-old kid, and a Lexus for the staff. It’s a game of appearances. If there’s a big Hollywood party and you’re not invited, people lock all their cars in the garage and pretend they’re out of town!”\n\nHer own staff would be considered modest in the Hollywood hierarchy: a maid, a secretary, a majordomo to run the house, the security guard. Why does she need an armed guard? “Well, I’ve been held up at gunpoint driving in Beverly Hills,” she said, making it seem mundane. “I’ve had an Uzi machine gun held two inches from my nose and some guy saying to me, ‘Don’t move, bitch, or I’ll blow your fucking head off.’ After that, you get a little nervous. But I made a daring escape. I hit the gas pedal and zoomed off screaming to my passengers, ‘Duck!’ The guy looked so startled he didn’t fire. I wouldn’t be telling the tale if he had.”\n\n\nDoes she own a gun?\n\n“I do now. I took shooting lessons. You know why? This is *the Wild West!”* At which point something went crash, disturbing the stillness of the house, and she cried, *“Earthquake!”* It turned out to be a mild tremor caused by her dog of low descent. However, only in L.A. would one ask if a house happened to be earthquake-proof.\n\n“It depends on how big the quake is,” she replied. “Look what happened in Japan. Kobe was supposed to be quakeproof. There’s a lot of steel in the structure to my house, which helps. But you never know. I thought the end had come during the L.A. quake last year. I was in the house, and a lot of things got smashed, including me afterward. The house rocked and rolled. I leapt out of bed and ran through flying glass into the hallway. I stayed there with the dogs until it was over.”\n\nBeverly Hills houses are often on the move, one way or another. Five years ago on the same land, she razed a house to the ground to build the current one. “It wasn’t worth putting the existing house on a truck and carting it off to some other place. It was crumbling. It looked like Tara in *Gone with the Wind* after it had been attacked.” The process, known to millionaire Angelenos as “teardown,” took a few hours, and the house disappeared.\n\nShe looked stoic telling the story of how the new home came about. She formerly lived in a smaller Beverly Hills house once owned by movie star Carroll Baker, and raised her three daughters there. But in 1990, her husband of 20 happy years, Oscar Lerman, fell seriously ill.\n\n“I wanted to create a project that would fire his imagination and excite him through the struggle, so I decided to build our dream house. Oscar was a wonderful man, nearly 25 years older than me. It was as though he said, ‘O.K. You’ve got that 25 years now. Go on to have that fantastic life.’”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe house took three years to build. Her husband died when it was finished. But she made the half-crazy creation of the house sound fun—a *good* memory. She had drawn sketches of what she wanted, and her husband also contributed: two amateur architects. She had imagined not a house exactly, but a David Hockney swimming pool with house attached. “I’d always wanted the Hockney painting *A Bigger Splash,*” she explained. “But I could never get it. So I thought the best alternative was to have my own Hockney pool that looked like the painting.”\n\nThe pool now sits like a cool, virtual-reality Hockney in a marble courtyard with the house surrounding it. But it took a while. There were a few creative differences with the original architect. (Don’t mess with Jackie.) Then, attending a baby shower for the wife of Wolfgang Puck of Spago fame, she walked into a beach house designed by Richard Meier. “That was *it!*” She bonded with Meier’s builder, Ardie Tavangarian of Arya, who built her house. Hence the openness and light, the stucco and glass, of its clean, minimalist modernism.\n\nAgainst the Hollywood grain, she didn’t hire an interior designer. “You go into a lot of Beverly Hills mansions and they belong to the decorator. You never feel the person *in* the house. But this is the most exciting thing I’ve ever done! I obsessed over *everything*—every light switch, every plug, every telephone outlet, every palm tree.”\n\nBeverly Hills style is every style, forged in freedom and whimsy—palatial neo-Tudor, southern antebellum, Victorian gingerbread, Venetian moderne, revivalist Renaissance, Spanish colonial, Hänsel and Gretel, *Leave It to Beaver.* But Jackie Collins’s fantasy belongs to her, a blank canvas on which she’s creating a new life, a modern Art Deco mirage in muted beige and startling white gigantism—a place, it was discovered during her guided tour, which belongs to an art collector, a TV junkie, a flea-market enthusiast, a party giver, a workaholic, and a Ping-Pong player.\n\nSplit security video screens are placed strategically in the house, watching. A golf cart would have been useful for the tour. The passageway alongside the pool, about 80 feet long, is an art gallery linking the front of the house to the back. Her late husband owned two art galleries, one in London, the other in L.A. The eclectic modern collection, which defies the nouveau Hollywood Picasso-Matisse style, is mostly by unknown artists they both liked. The gallery passageway turns into a more traditional sight, a screening room. (The screen descends, wheezing, over a painting.) She’s acquisitive: shelves display odd flea-market bargains, a collection of anthropomorphic teapots, jolly fat pottery people, 1930s china bellboys. Next door to the screening room, the Collins GHQ begins.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nUpstairs from the secretary’s office, with its twin word processors, is an entire floor that has a photographic studio, which leads to Jackie’s enormous office—one of two—with its trademark leopard painting and mogul desk; the office, surprisingly, opens into a Ping-Pong room, where she plays a fierce, attacking game, taking no prisoners, as I discovered when we played.\n\nOn this floor she writes the scripts of her TV mini-series (spin-offs of her novels) and takes production meetings. Her second office, where she writes the books, adjoins her bedroom in the main house. In effect, she runs a mini-empire from home.\n\nThe house revolves around the pool and work. She gets up each day at seven, working virtually on coffee until early evening. Then she unwinds in front of a TV, and invariably goes out to dinner or a party to record the secrets, she says, of the innocent and not so innocent. “If I wrote about the stories of nice people who live in Hollywood, everyone would be bored to tears by page 2,” she explained.\n\n“But there’s something different going on behind most other doors, and no door is ever the same. There might be a perfectly happy producer and his wife who knew all the great movie stars of the past. And next door is a pimp or fading movie actress who’s had too much plastic surgery, or—this is a true story, but I can’t name him—a drugged-out young movie star who’s married to a beautiful girl who used to be a hooker. But he didn’t realize this until he walked into a party one night and every guy in the place greeted her very warmly.”\n\nShe laughed. She loves L.A.—quakes, floods, fires, riots, and all. “My childhood fantasy *was* Hollywood,” she explained. She was raised in a basement apartment on Sherlock Holmes’s Baker Street with her equally remarkable big sister, Joan (formerly of Beverly Hills, more recently of London and the South of France). Their father was a theatrical agent. “As a child I had every picture of the Hollywood stars plastered to the walls of my room. I wrote about 20 fan letters a *week* to them. Now I write novels about them—changing the names, of course.”\n\nLucky Santangelo, the Collins heroine and predatory hustler who last appeared taking control of a Hollywood studio, returns in the new novel she’s currently writing. She’s also producing and writing the mini-series of her latest best-seller, *Hollywood Kids,* about the wasted offspring of the famous, “who have everything except an identity.” And she’s also shooting a CBS special concerning the sexual secrets of men, designing her sometimes-leopard-inspired jewelry collection for the Home Shopping Network, and selling her scent called Wild.\n\n“Jackie,” I said, “enough is enough. You gotta be kidding about the scent called Wild.”\n\n“That’s what I said when they asked me to do it!” she replied.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nShe’s fun, as I say, obliging, criticproof, and unbeatable. We adjourned to a kitchen the size of a chic canteen. It leads into the dining room, or intimate restaurant. Adjoining that, the sitting room, with its long, generous bar, opens onto the Hockney pool and links to a smaller den with a giant TV, a pool table, and white baby-grand piano. “This is a great house for a party,” she pointed out, and it surely is. If she throws a big party, she goes more traditionally Hollywood: valet parking, superior caterers, actors and models as Armani-clad waiters. But the parties are un-Hollywood in this sense. “Hollywood parties end at about 10 P.M.,” she explained. “They *run* home. I mean, what’s the point? Perhaps it’s because I’m English, but the natives don’t really know how to relax and enjoy themselves. Michael Caine always says the reason the English are the last to leave is because they’re waiting for the party to *begin.* It’s true! Anyway, my parties last until about two A.M.”\n\nFor all her Hollywood fame, Jackie Collins remains the British expatriate at heart, the insider-outsider, which is exactly where she wants to be. That night, she was cooking for a few friends—another sacrilege (along with eating in the kitchen) among the hierarchical rules of the fastidious Hollywood elites. She was cooking shepherd’s pie, traditional English pub grub, with another national delicacy, English baked beans. “I love it!” she said. “Everyone does.”\n\nCan’t get more English than shepherd’s pie. Or more un-Hollywood, in her fantasy-Hollywood way.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/557f3f9c320a56cf4241183e]||||||\n\n\n",
