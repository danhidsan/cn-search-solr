  "body":" \n*Each week, Josh Duboff looks at the biggest celebrity news—and amuses himself by imagining how those celebrities might have reacted.*\n\n__Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen are photographed holding hands on their way out of a movie amidst rumors of trouble in their marriage.__\n \n“We should have seen the Tom Cruise movie,” Tom mumbles, as he and Gisele sit in the backseat of their car, on their way home.\n \n“*Minions*?” Gisele asks, absently, as she scrolls on her phone.\n \n“Yes, Gisele, Tom Cruise is in the Minions movie.”\n \nGisele looks up. “Sorry, I wasn’t paying attention. Jesus.” She turns her phone off and pushes her hair out of her eyes. “What, you didn’t like it?”\n\n“Eh, it was O.K. I thought it was going to be totally different, like . . . about an actual uncle.”\n \n“U.N.C.L.E. There are dots between the letters, Tom.”\n \n“Yes, Gisele, thank you, I know that now.”\n \nTom looks out the window, while Gisele reaches into her handbag, fumbling around, looking for something.\n \nTheir driver turns around and shouts over the partition, “If I may interject, Mr. Brady, I remember thinking that both of the actors in that movie looked like off-brand versions of you.”\n\nTom laughs, and Gisele grins. “He wishes,” Gisele shouts back.\n \nTom puts his hand on Gisele’s. “The season’s about to start, babe,” he whispers. “Things will be getting back to normal.”\n \n“Back to normal,” Gisele repeats, not looking Tom in the eyes.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n \n__Serena Williams loses in the semi-finals of the U.S. Open in a massive upset. Drake, her rumored boyfriend, attends the match, standing for much of it.__\n \nDrake, wearing headphones, stands outside Serena’s locker room after the match. Venus Williams leans against a wall nearby. Drake pulls off the headphones and walks over to her. \n \n“What?” Venus asks, before Drake says anything.\n \n“Do you think I should, like—”\n \n“No.”\n \n“You don’t even know what I was going to say!”\n \n“The answer is no.” \n \nDrake looks around, as Venus picks at her jacket.\n \n“But you don’t think—”\n \n“I do.”\n \n“How do you know . . .? I was gonna ask if you think I should give her some space, and head out . . .”\n \n“Yes, I knew that.”\n \nDrake sits down on the floor, up against the wall, and puts his hands on his head.\n \nVenus looks down and shakes her head. “*Now* you decide to sit down!” \n\n\n----------\n\n\n \n__Jennifer Lawrence says in [an interview with *The New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/movies/jennifer-lawrence-has-no-appetite-for-playing-fame-games.html): “. . . then Josh [Hutcherson] called me and told me he had a dream about Woody [Harrelson]. And then my friend came over to my house and told me she had a sex dream about Liam [Hemsworth].”__\n \nJosh texts Jennifer: lol that interview\n \nJennifer: hahah\n \nJennifer: yeah\n \nJosh: which friend of yours had the liam dream?\n \nJennifer: why???\n \n*An hour passes.* \n \nJosh: why aren’t any of your friends having dreams about me!!!\n\nJennifer: ew josh\n \nJosh: ew????\n \nJennifer: omg dreams are random! You had one about WOODY\n \nJennifer: about eating grapes together at a press junket, right???\n \nJennifer: don’t even think about it\n \nJennifer: dreams dont mean anything\n \nJosh: yeah, that’s true\n \nJennifer: <3\n \n*Three hours pass.*\n \nJosh: have you watched this new HBO show ‘show me a hero’?\n \nJosh: it’s really good\n \n*Four hours pass.*\n \nJosh: oh btw tell amy schumer I think she is gold\n\nJosh: *cool\n\nJosh: hahaha i think she is gold too!\n\nJosh: hope u r having a good night!\n \n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Aniston go on a double date in Austin with Justin Theroux and Bryan Randall.__\n \nJennifer and Sandra wait outside for the valet. Justin is in the bathroom; Bryan went back into the restaurant to get his coat.\n \n“That was really fun!” Sandra says.\n \n“Yeah, yeah, it was,” Jen responds.\n \n“I . . . you guys seems so happy, and *tan*, and you know . . . you guys could be stock-photo models, for like, the word *healthy*.”\n \n“*Healthy*, I don’t know . . . did you see how many of those sweet potato fries I had?!”\n \n“You had like one and a half fries, Jen!”\n \nThey both laugh, Sandra slightly more guardedly than Jen.\n \n“So . . . . you. . . ?”\n \n“*Yes*, Sandy, I love Bryan, I’ve told you,” Jen says, as she puts her coat on. “How’s he handling . . . it all?”\n \n“Well, you know, it’s *a lot*,” Sandra says, checking to make sure Bryan isn’t coming up behind them. “I saw him turn kind of pale yesterday when he saw his name on like five magazines while we were in line at Barnes & Noble.”\n \n“Oh yeah, with Justin, it took about six months for him to, you know, not tense up every time we were going to go out to walk the dogs, or leave a restaurant. And *he* was semi-famous before!”\n \n“Yeah, I think it will get easier when—oh yes, I *love a good salmon avocado roll*, too, Jen! Hey, Bryan!”\n\n__Previously: [Imagined Celebrity Connections: Jennifer Aniston Catches Up With Vince Vaughn](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/jennifer-aniston-vince-vaughn-wedding)__",
