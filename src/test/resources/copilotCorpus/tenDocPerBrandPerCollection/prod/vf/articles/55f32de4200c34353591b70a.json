  "body":"__Robert De Niro__ may have spent the past five decades [finessing a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor on-screen](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/1987/10/robert-de-niro-life-story), but that doesn’t mean that the man can’t enjoy [a little fluffy, romantic competition reality series,](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/the-bachelor-finale-photos-most-profound-moments) does it? Is there some statute that says *Taxi Driver*’s [Travis Bickle](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/best-movies-about-new-york-city) can’t take in a rose ceremony, cursing at the screen when Sam clearly picks the wrong contestant? (“Did Heather sharing her emotional childhood mean nothing to you?!”) A law banning Vito Corleone from DVR-ing a group hot-tub date? Or a mandate preventing Johnny Boy from appreciating a finely choreographed group date in Iowa? No, there aren’t. \n\nDuring a sprawling new interview, __Anne Hathaway__—De Niro’s co-star in the upcoming __Nancy Meyers__–directed comedy *The Intern*—lets the proverbial cat out of the bag, telling [Refinery 29](http://www.refinery29.com/2015/09/92930/anne-hathaway-movies-hollywood-feminist-interview#.1rzjvd:tS7P), “The man loves *The Bachelor*.” The Oscar winner claims De Niro is so into the ABC reality series ([much like __Amy Schumer__](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/amy-schumer-bachelorette)) that, per Refinery 29, “he was thrilled to hear that ads for *The Intern* were running during *Bachelor in Paradise*.” To prove that De Niro is in fact a card-carrying member of *Bachelor* nation, Hathaway produces her phone for the Refinery 29 writer and reads an excerpt from an e-mail De Niro sent to Hathaway and Meyers: “You bet your ass I’m a big *Bachelor* fan!”\n\nDe Niro is not the only member of *The Intern* production fascinated by the ABC reality franchise. In [an interview with Vulture](http://www.vulture.com/2015/09/nancy-meyers-amy-larocca-in-conversation.html), Meyers speaks at length about the most recent season of *The Bachelorette*, which she just finished.\n\n“There is nothing more compelling,” Meyers says. “I only fast-forward through group dates. The group date, I have to admit, I’m not that into. But the second they’re alone with the two shots, then I know it’s going to begin. There’s no chance I’m fast-forwarding. By the way, since when was falling in love so easily documented? ‘I’m falling, I was falling in love. I’m falling in love with two people.’ Really?”\n\nMeyers has questions for *The Bachelor* producers, too: “How do these people ignore the camera so beautifully?” She explains, “When someone’s uncomfortable like Ben, who was the third runner-up, he becomes to me the most authentic, the best guy there. Because I could see it just did not come easily to him to be this open all the time with his feelings and kissing in front of the camera. I mean, have you ever kissed in front of a camera? It’s awkward!”\n\nIf De Niro and Meyers are fans of *The Bachelor*, may we humbly suggest that they check out [*Unreal*, the Lifetime scripted series set behind the scenes of a *Bachelor*-type reality show](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/unreal-shiri-appleby-rachel-female-anti-hero)? It’s worth your DVR space, we promise.\n\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/55e70529669d2a14709fc841]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n",
