  "body":"When __Donald Trump__ first announced his presidency earlier this summer, *The Daily Show’s* __Jon Stewart__ called it a “gift from heaven” and __Tina Fey__—who has gotten plenty of ammunition from Republican candidates in the past—declared it “great for comedy!” And they were right. Stewart and Fey and everyone in between has been having plenty of fun at the expense of the Donald Trump and his enigmatic coiffure. But even Stewart laced that first “Trump for President” segment with biting commentary. Calling Trump a “[batshit billionaire](http://www.cc.com/video-collections/tsb297/donald-trump-is-running-for-president/gyhfub)” and later [worse](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ow94ov/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-rant-man), Stewart, at least, seemed to recognize Trump as someone to occasionally be taken seriously. With Stewart gone, there’s still an army of late-night hosts with the opportunity to hold Trump—who is [*still* leading in the polls](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/22/poll-outsiders-donald-trump-ben-carson-still-leading-gop-race/)—accountable for some of the offensive rhetoric he spews. Then why are the men with the biggest audiences—__Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon,__ and __Stephen Colbert__—going so soft on Trump? \n\nIn the past few weeks, Trump has either appeared on or been the subject of a major segment on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, *The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon*, and *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*. Perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that the Jimmys—who are well-established clown princes—didn’t bring out the big guns when tackling Trump. On September 16, Kimmel did *exactly* what he does best: he orchestrated a prank. Kimmel sent __Tony Barbieri__ a.k.a. Jake Byrd to a Trump rally in Texas, but the target of this segment were *really* the clueless Trump supporters (one lady chanted “DTF” along with Byrd, mistakenly thinking it meant “Donald Trump Forever”). And while this was essentially a Trumped up edition of Kimmel’s popular [Lie Witness News](http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live/video/lie-witness-news) segment, Byrd’s antics behind Trump during the rally itself was actually pretty gently humorous. \n\n[#video: //www.youtube.com/embed/jIMsKvbHN3g?feature=player_detailpage](640x360)||||||\n\nAnd like Kimmel, Fallon also played to his own strengths treating Donald Trump’s September 11th appearance like a glorified *S.N.L.* sketch. Fallon dressed as Trump and conducted half the interview as a mirror-like conversation between two Trumps. In the Trump guise, Fallen took shots at his own reputation saying, “Let’s be honest, Fallon’s a lightweight. No way he deserves to interview me.” And the premise of the two-way Trump conversation allowed the Donald to easily evade question after question. How would Trump create jobs in the U.S? “I’m just gonna do it,” Trump responded. “Right, but how?” asked Fallon. “By doing it. It just happens,” Trump said. \n\nLater Fallon asked, “You said you’d get Mexico to build a wall at the border. How would you do that?” And Trump, taking full advantage of the segment structure, replied, “Since I’m you, why don’t you tell me?” Fallon did manage to wrest one bit of important commentary from Trump. When asked if he ever apologized Trump dropped the now-classic response, “I think apologizing’s a great thing, but you have to be wrong. I will absolutely apologize, sometime in the hopefully distant future, if I’m ever wrong.”\n\n[#video: //www.youtube.com/embed/c2DgwPG7mAA?feature=player_embedded](640x360)||||||\n\nBut if anyone was in a position to take up the Stewart mantle and pin a slippery Trump down, it would be Stewart’s old Comedy Central buddy Stephen Colbert. But as Colbert proved during Tuesday night’s show, he’s much more interested in humoring Trump than holding him actually accountable. Which is odd, given that just the night before, Colbert held Senator __Ted Cruz’s__ feet over the fire when discussing Ronald Reagan’s legacy, [repeating questions over and over](http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2015/09/stephen-colbert-ted-cruz-reagan-legacy) and not giving Cruz room to slip sideways out of the conversation. Meanwhile, when he asked Trump \n\n\n\nJohn Oliver \n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwzDJqelLPw\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nIf you were looking for a hard-hitting interview. \n\n\nI’m going to need until January. \nhttp://www.cc.com/video-clips/nfdb0h/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-studying-for-2016\n\n\n\n“Can we talk about the election for a second? I know, as the Late Show host, I have huge responsibilities … I promise you, just like the rest of the media, I will be covering all the presidential candidates who are Donald Trump.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I haven’t heard what his actual policy is going to be. But if it can be fixed, he’ll fix it.”\n\n\n\n\nStephen Colbert—September 22\n----------------------------\n\n[Colbert impression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFVC3qYGYiE)\n\n“You are setting the world on fire right now.” \n\n”Money is speech and you’re a ten billion dollar mouth.“",
