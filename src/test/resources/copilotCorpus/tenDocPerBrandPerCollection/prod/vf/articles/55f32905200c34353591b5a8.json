  "body":"So, here’s the story on the man who paints the town and everything in it, __[Donald Robertson](http://www.donaldrobertson.com/)__ who is simply known as either “Donald” on everything he’s drawn on or __[@Drawbertson](https://instagram.com/drawbertson/?hl=en)__ on his ever-popular Instagram feed, painting whatever and wherever he is. In town for Fashion Week, Robertson decided to give us a little glimpse of the madness in his headspace and tell his story at __[Story](http://thisisstory.com/)__, a retail concept store where they tell different stories, so to speak, every few weeks. This week and next, throughout Fashion Week only, you can experience the artist’s madness, from his illustration-emblazoned shirts to a Rolex watch to Smashbox Cosmetics lipsticks and everything in between, at Story, which is located in Chelsea.  \n\n[#image: /photos/55f33e0b200c34353591b96f]||||||\n\nDuring the day, check out all of his cool collaborations (more than 20!) and shop away! There’s a __[Canada Goose](http://www.canada-goose.com/us/en/home-page?gclid=COnzif_S78cCFZYYHwodX-4MAw)__ down vest that can be customized with a “Donald” emoji design of choice, and you can do the same with a __[J. Crew](https://www.jcrew.com)__ T-shirt and super-fab sweatshirts provided by __[Bow & Drape](http://www.bowanddrape.com/)__. And did I say Rolex? Yes, indeed I did! A one-of-a-kind Rolex watch designed by Donald and Bamford Watch Department will certainly keep the conversation rolling, to boot. But if that’s too over-the-top,  you can rely on __[Smashbox Cosmetics](http://www.smashbox.com)__ to make custom lip shades to your liking at their lip-gloss mixing station, drawing from their __Be Legendary Lipsticks,__ exclusive to Story. Then there’s the __[Shinola](http://www.shinola.com/)__ leather zip clutches, and let’s not forget about his collaboration with __[Diet Coke](http://www.dietcoke.com/)__! \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f349e2fad0d98d444d11be]||||||\n\n\n\nRight by the entrance, there’s a very good-looking cooler, and when you follow the instructions and Tweet at it, pop goes the lid, and you can grab a Donald-covered bottle—a keepsake, no doubt. And there’s *a lot* more! But it’s for a limited-time only, so, don’t walk, run, because when this chapter is closed at Story, everything will be gone, as if it never happened! But you’re just too crazed and can’t get there because it’s Fashion Week? Well, Donald and Story founder __[Rachel Shechtman](http://thisisstory.com/our-story/)__ thought of that! Through the 27th, you can shop through the __[MikMak iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mikmak-watch-laugh-shop/id954861140?mt=8)__, a first-of-its-kind video shopping network, where you can watch commercials and easily make purchases from your seat at a fashion show. Yes, folks, this is the 21st century, and it’s just all cool stuff.\n\n\nAnd in the evenings, you can meet @Drawbertson the man in the flesh and live to tell your own story about the experience! He’s at Story this weekend with friends giving talks, but check the Web site for space. Like I said, run, don't walk, as you will only have this one opportunity to buy something for anyone from 1 to 100 years old. Can you say “crowd-pleaser?“ Yup, that’s him. As seen in __[*Vanity Fair’*s September issue, Donald Robertson](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2015/08/donald-drawbertson-robertson-fashion-artist)__ is simply an *Über*-crowd-pleaser that brings life into full-color happiness. \n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f34ef1200c34353591bc77]|||\nTop: SunHee Grinnell with Donald Robertson.
