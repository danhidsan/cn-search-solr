  "body":"Ask most cynics what could pop the tech bubble and you’ll hear sermons on inflated valuations and unsustainably thin margins. But the biggest, most underestimated risk to the current crop of hot start-ups could be a good old-fashioned worker revolution. \n\nSo-called “1099” workers—independent contractors who file the 1099-MISC tax form, not the employee’s W-2—have formed the backbone of many of Silicon Valley’s hottest start-ups—plenty backed, founded, or managed by those named to the New Establishment, *Vanity Fair*’s annual accounting of business and media elite, [released this week](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/new-establishment-list-2015). If you’ve hailed an Uber, gotten a Postmates delivery, or had a meal-on-wheels service like SpoonRocket bring food to your door, you’ve dealt with one. For founders, the advantages of using 1099 contractors are that they're cheap: no payroll tax, no workers’ comp insurance, no equipment expenses or pay for downtime. For the workers, a 1099 arrangement gives them flexibility to work when they want, and stay home when they don't.\n\nBut recently, the 1099s have started striking back, with class-action lawsuits that allege that their companies violated labor law by classifying them as contractors, but controlling them as tightly as hourly employees. If these lawsuits succeed, start-ups could be forced to pay millions of dollars in back taxes and penalties, and many business models that hinge on cheap labor could be turned upside down. __Shannon Liss-Riordan,__ the Boston lawyer leading the class-action charge against Uber, is also representing workers from Lyft, Postmates, and other 1099 employers. “Just because your services are dispatched through a smartphone doesn’t make you a technology company,\" [she told Fusion](http://fusion.net/story/118401/meet-the-lawyer-taking-on-uber-and-the-on-demand-economy/) in April. Earlier this month, a district court judge agreed, and granted class-action status to a group of Uber drivers, allowing their claim to move forward.\n\nTo avoid a courtroom shock that could derail their momentum, some start-ups have started using W-2 employees voluntarily. But the price of 1099 workers is still too tempting for most start-ups to pass up. And if judges and juries decide that the Uber model violates existing labor laws, a whole host of on-demand companies could find a new bubble appearing, this time on their payroll.",
