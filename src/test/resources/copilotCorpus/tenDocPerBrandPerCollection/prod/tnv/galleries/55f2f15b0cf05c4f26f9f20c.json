For some of the models, he topped the extended inky feline flick with a coating of punk rock gold glitter. Paired with a bright, fire engine-red lip…this is what beauty dreams are made of. ",

The look is very eclectic with a lot of layering, which plays off the layering in the collection,” says de Mey. He used a combination of [Nars Black Valley Eye Paint](http://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/black-valley-eye-paint/0607845081418.html#q=black+valley&start=1), [Black Moon Eyeliner Pencil](http://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/black-moon-eyeliner-pencil/0607845080039.html#q=black+moon&start=4) and [Via Veneto Larger Than Life Eyeliner](http://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/via-veneto-larger-than-life-long-wear-eyeliner/0607845080510.html#q=via+veneto&start=4) to achieve this punky eye moment. ",

And although this might not be school-appropriate, we think that whenever you can incorporate edgy sparkles into your look, why wouldn’t you? Use [Nars Eye Paint in Iskander](http://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/iskandar-eye-paint/0607845081500.html), then press the shimmer and shine up to your brow for a graphic effect. Wear your hair mussed up like the models at the show for an effortlessly cool vibe. ",

I stressed out over a lot of things—looking back I realize how big a waste of time that is. \n\n__What’s your favorite Teen Vogue moment?__ \n\nI have so many amazing *Teen Vogue* memories. I think my favorite was assisting on the Leighton Meester February 2009 cover shoot back when I was an intern. I was obsessed with Gossip Girl, and being on set in the LES with Leighton and Patrick Demachelier was definitely one the highlights of my entire college experience. At one point I had to stop pedestrians from walking into the shot and I remember thinking I’ve made it. Haha.\n\n__Share a funny anecdote from a first job or internship.__ \n\nOn my first day of my first internship, EVER, at *Teen Vogue* my purse hit the elevator alarm and the elevator stopped mid-ride—it was completely packed, too. I was mortified.  \n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__\n\nI can’t get enough of the Maybelline Master Kajal black liner. I love kohl-rimmed liner and this one is perfect. I also love that as it wears down you get an even more smudgy, smoky, rock ’n’ roll vibe. It’s basically the gift that keeps on giving. \n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__ \n\nI can never have enough pairs of black jeans, but right now I’m in the market for overalls, culottes and a denim dress. \n\n__What’s your go-to karaoke song?__ \n\n\"You Oughta Know” by Alanis Morissette, of course. \n\n__Who’s your favorite model and why?__ \n\nWell, it’s hard to pick, because I love models. But right now, I’m loving Cat McNeil. She’s confident, quirky and has amazing tattoos. \n\n__What’s your favorite Instagram to follow (other than Teen Vogue)?__ \n\nI follow a ton of models that I love, but right now my favorite Instagram is [@theacademynewyork](https://instagram.com/theacademynewyork/). They post really out-there images and quotes. And anything cat-related is always an instant-follow. \n\n__What’s your favorite meal?__ \n\nTacos! All day, every day. ",
