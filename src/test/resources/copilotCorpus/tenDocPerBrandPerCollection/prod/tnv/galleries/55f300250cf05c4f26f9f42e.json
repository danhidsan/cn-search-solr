      "caption":"We look to Instagram, magazines, and red carpets for inspiration but, more importantly, we love to see ourselves and our brand of beauty represented in the media. For women with naturally wavy, curly, and coily hair, this can be a challenge in a sea of extensions and curling wand-induced “beachy waves.” If you’re searching for a curly hair twin for haircut inspiration, to discover products that work for you, or just to know you’re not the only one out there with your hair type, look no further. Here are women across the textured hair spectrum along with our tips to help you better understand your hair type and the products you need for your best curls, ever.   \n\nWe know that “curly” means a lot of things to a lot of people, so at NaturallyCurly we have a [Texture Typing system](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/learn/curly-hair-guide-whats-your-curl-pattern-hi/) that breaks it down. Knowing your curl pattern can help you find the styling products and techniques that will work for you.   \n\nCurls are so unique, that it can be close to impossible to find an identical hair twin. For example, you may have Tori Kelly’s S-shaped waves but with finer hair or less density, so your curls may look completely different. Or, maybe you have a mix between Nathalie Emmaneul’s 3c and Yaya Dacosta’s 4a curls. Most people are a mix of a couple of curl patterns, so if you feel like you fall into more than one category, that’s totally normal.  \n\nIt can be helpful to find other curlies out there who have similar hair to yours, so you can try their favorite products and follow their tutorials, but what ultimately works for you is going to be 100% unique. Now it’s time to find your hair twin.   ",

      "caption":"If your hair looks like Arizona’s, your curl pattern is Type 2a. Your hair is not quite straight, but your waves are not fully defined. This means it can be easily straightened, or you can play up your wavy texture. Your hair tends to be fine in density, and though your hair type has a natural sheen to it, it’s not particularly voluminous. To add more volume and definition to your waves, we recommend [plopping](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/to-plop-or-not-to-plop/) your soaking wet hair on top of your head with an old T-shirt when you get out of the shower to encourage your waves and prevent frizz. When your hair is wet, scrunch a small amount of curl cream, like [AG Hair Beach Bomb](http://www.curlmart.com/product/ag-hair-cosmetics-beach-bomb/) and [L’Oreal EverCurl’s Cream-Gel](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5250249), through your hair for effortless, tousled waves with light, touchable hold. ",

      "caption":"Tori Kelly used to be insecure about her hair and would straighten it when she was younger, but once she figured out how to take care of it, she grew to love her big wavy curls. And we do too!   \n\nIf your hair forms large, defined, S-shaped waves, then you have Type 2b hair. Your hair has defined waves when it’s wet, but if you don’t use the right techniques, it can easily lose its definition. To prevent the dreaded frizz halo, use a wide tooth comb while conditioning in the shower, this will encourage your curls to clump. Then, when you get out of the shower, use a light gel like [DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4630083) or [Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle](http://www.curlmart.com/product/curl-junkie-curls-in-a-bottle/), which will not weigh down fine hair. If you want volume like Tori’s, flip your head forward so that you’re upside down and use a diffuser attachment on the cool setting to dry your hair. Doing this with your head flipped forward will create lift at the roots, so that your hair doesn’t dry plastered to your head.  ",

      "caption":"Lorde represents our #hairlengthgoals, but even if your hair is not as long, you may share those defined waves mixed in with actual curls. We call this Type 2c. Type 2c curls and waves can be very unpredictable. Some days you wake up with ringlets, and some days your hair doesn’t want to curl. To take the guesswork out of your morning, try sleeping with your hair in several braids, so you can wake up with uniform waves. In the morning, unravel your braids, use your fingers to fluff them out, and finger twirl any spots that look out of shape. To keep your hair from feeling dry, make sure to use a spray leave-in conditioner like [Deva Curl Set It Free](http://www.curlmart.com/product/devacurl-set-it-free-1/) or [Obia Curl Hydration Spray](http://www.curlmart.com/product/obia-natural-hair-care-curl-hydration-spray/).",

In order to keep your curls shiny and looking healthy like Annalynne's, you’ll want to avoid sulfate shampoos, and cleanse your hair less often, because that can dry out your hair and scalp. To achieve gorgeous 2nd and 3rd day hair, put distilled water and leave-in conditioner in a spray bottle, and spritz your hair with this mix in the morning. It will reactivate your styling products and revive your flattened or out-of-shape curls. You can also use refresher sprays like [Curl Junkie Curl Fuel Curl Enhancing Spray](http://www.curlmart.com/product/curl-junkie-curl-fuel-curl-enhancing-spray/) or [Jessicurl Awe Inspiraling Spray](http://www.curlmart.com/product/curl-junkie-curl-fuel-curl-enhancing-spray/) for juicy curls all week long.",

      "caption":"Crystal’s hair forms ringlets about the size of a Sharpie marker, so she has Type 3b curls. Crystal’s curls are dense and voluminous, but sometimes 3b curls can fall flat and have random stragglers. To reshape curls and “spot treat” any frizz, rub a little defining styling product on your hands, then use your fingers to twirl the individual curls, scrunching them at the end. Use defining products with moisturizing ingredients like [Briogeo’s Leave-In Defining Creme](http://www.curlmart.com/product/briogeo-curl-charisma-rice-amino-avocado-leave-in-defining-creme/) or [Ouidad’s Climate Control Heat & Humidity Gel](http://www.curlmart.com/product/climate-control-heat-and-humidity-gel/). To achieve Crystal’s shape and volume, when your hair is completely dry, use your fingers to shake up your curls at the roots. Don’t skip this step!  ",

      "caption":"If you have corkscrew curls like Nathalie’s, then you have Type 3c hair. Type 3c is usually higher in density (meaning you have a lot of hair) and is typically the coarsest of all Type 3 hair. You may find that your hair tends to feel dry and starts to lose its definition, so it’s important to co-wash (use conditioner to cleanse) rather than using shampoo regularly. You can use a daily conditioner like Elucence Balancing Moisturizer, or you can buy a co-wash product like [As I Am Cleansing Conditioner](http://www.curlmart.com/product/as-i-am-coconut-cowash-cleansing-conditioner/). You can co-wash and still feel clean, just make sure to rub your scalp with the pads of your fingers to lift and remove any dirt or residue.

      "caption":"Yaya’s curls are similar to the circumference of a crochet needle, which is Type 4a hair. These curls are tighter in circumference and usually high in density. The hair strands also have fewer cuticle layers than other hair types, so this hair type needs more protection from damage caused by the elements. To protect your hair from rubbing on your pillow at night, twist it with a moisturizing curl definer like [TIGI Catwalk Curlesque Curls Rock Amplifier](http://www.curlmart.com/product/tigi-catwalk-curlesque-curls-rock-amplifier/), which will create defined 4a curls and help shield them from the elements. Also, make sure to sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or bonnet, as this will prevent friction. The next morning, untwist your hair, and gently fluff it for added volume. ",

      "caption":"If you were to look closely at a strand of Willow’s hair, it would probably resemble a well-defined Z-shape. These strands can be fine or wiry (coarse) and tend to shrink up to 75% of their true length (that is why your hair looks so much shorter). To elongate your hair, use techniques like twist outs, flexi rod sets, or bantu knot-outs to stretch your hair without heat. In order to retain your length, it’s important to maintain moisture at all times. One way is to apply an oil like [EDEN BodyWorks Jojoba All-Natural Oil](http://www.t.com/product/eden-body-works-jojoba-all-natural-hair-oil/) to your scalp prior to washing, to help you retain your natural sebum. This is also known as “[pre-pooing](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/kinky-hair-type-4a/5-reasons-you-should-pre-poo/).” We know the word sounds silly, but this step can really save your hair!",

      "caption":"If your strands are a mix of Z-shaped strands and tight coils that resemble the spring in a pen, then you have Type 4c hair like Lupita’s. These coils are much tighter than the other Type 4 textures and are less likely to clump into coils without the use of styling techniques. To keep your coils feeling healthy, it’s important to deep condition once a week with moisturizers like [SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen, Grow & Restore Treatment Masque](http://www.curlmart.com/product/sheamoisture-jamaican-black-castor-oil-strengthen-grow-and-restore-treatment-masque/), which will moisturize your hair but won’t leave a greasy after-feeling. Follow up with a conditioning styler like [Oyin Handmade’s Boing!](http://www.curlmart.com/product/oyin-handmade/), which will give you soft definition whether you’re wearing a wash-and-go or a twist-out. ",
