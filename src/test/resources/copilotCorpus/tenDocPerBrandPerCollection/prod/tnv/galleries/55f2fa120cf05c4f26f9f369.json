And that's exactly what the British girl group [Little Mix](http://www.teenvogue.com/tag/little-mix) have managed to do, inducing quite the hair envy in all of us every time one of Perrie, Leigh-Anne, Jesy or Jade's killer styles pops up on our Instagram feed.\n\nThey have a new single out called “[Hair](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/little-mix-hair-stream-breakup-anthem),” so it only seems appropriate that they've mastered every look from sleek ponytails to volumized blowouts. If you're not yet familiar, let this serve as your crash course in the many crazy, quirky and cool hairstyles of our new favorite quartet. Because if the Spice Girls taught us anything (besides girl power) it was the importance of a girl band's hair — please see Posh's sleek bob, Scary's enviable curls, Baby's blonde pigtails, Sporty's high pony and Ginger's well, ginger hair, for further proof.\n\nAllow us to introduce you to all of the hair inspo you'll ever need. And Little Mix, consider this our official request to join the group, please and thanks.",

It's okay to be disappointed, but don't let it discourage you from trying again. And don't be too hard on yourself because things always have a way of working out -- I still need to give myself this advice.\n\n\n__What’s your favorite *Teen Vogue* moment?__\n\n\nGemma Ward's Teen Vogue cover from waaaay back in 2006. I was in high school at the time and she was my absolute favorite model -- it's still probably stashed in my room at home somewhere. Then, of course, having been such a fan of Teen Vogue, seeing my first post on the site.\n\n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__\n\nI could never pick just one, so bear with me here..the Dr. Jart+ Vital Hydra Solution sheet mask because it instantly perks up your skin, Rimmel London Wonder Lash Mascara, Charlotte Tilbury Beach Stick in Las Salinas and the Butter London Lip Crayon in the bright pink shade, Primrose Hill Picnic.\n\n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__\n\nTurtlenecks, dresses and boots -- always in black.\n\n\n__What’s your go-to karaoke song?__\n\n\"Spice Up Your Life\" or really anything by the Spice Girls.\n\n\n__Who’s your favorite model and why?__\n\nI've always been a big fan of Georgia May Jagger's quirky/cool style, especially after meeting her and learning she's also funny and kind, too.\n\n\n__What’s your favorite Instagram to follow (other than *Teen Vogue*)?__\n\nIf I want fun beauty pics, [@louteasdale](http://instagram.com/louteasdale). If I want to laugh, [@brosbeingbasic](http://instagram.com/brosbeingbasic).",
