And don't even get us started on *Grease*’s Pink Ladies. They wear matching jackets.\n\nScroll through the gallery to check out *Teen Vogue*’s favorite movie cliques of all time, and then feel free to buy your friend group some matching t-shirts. Preferably ones that say \"On Wednesdays We Wear Pink.\"",
