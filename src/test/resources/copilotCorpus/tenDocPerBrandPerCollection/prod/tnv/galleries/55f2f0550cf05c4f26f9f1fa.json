      "caption":"Recently, the [Oxford Dictionaries](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/08/new-words-update-manspreading-mic-drop) (the OED’s younger, hipper sister) announced the addition of a whole bunch of new words that you should definitely try to work into your English essays this school year. The dictionary focuses on modern language, so each year their new entries are pulled from things like pop culture, tech, and internet slang. And lest you think that these words are just trendy, there’s always a possibility that years and years (and years) from now, they’ll make their way into the real deal Oxford English dictionary. After all, William Shakespeare made up quite a few words in his day that have become mainstays of the English language. We’ve rounded up our favorites among the [new additions](http://time.com/4010748/oxford-dictionary-update-2015/) and just to be super helpful, we’ve used each and every one of them in a sentence (you know, so it’s even easier to slip them into your creative writing assignment).
