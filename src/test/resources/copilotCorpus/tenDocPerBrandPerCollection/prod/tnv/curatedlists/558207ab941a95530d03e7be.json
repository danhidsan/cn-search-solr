I stressed out over a lot of things—looking back I realize how big a waste of time that is. \n\n__What’s your favorite Teen Vogue moment?__ \n\nI have so many amazing *Teen Vogue* memories. I think my favorite was assisting on the Leighton Meester February 2009 cover shoot back when I was an intern. I was obsessed with Gossip Girl, and being on set in the LES with Leighton and Patrick Demachelier was definitely one the highlights of my entire college experience. At one point I had to stop pedestrians from walking into the shot and I remember thinking I’ve made it. Haha.\n\n__Share a funny anecdote from a first job or internship.__ \n\nOn my first day of my first internship, EVER, at *Teen Vogue* my purse hit the elevator alarm and the elevator stopped mid-ride—it was completely packed, too. I was mortified.  \n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__\n\nI can’t get enough of the Maybelline Master Kajal black liner. I love kohl-rimmed liner and this one is perfect. I also love that as it wears down you get an even more smudgy, smoky, rock ’n’ roll vibe. It’s basically the gift that keeps on giving. \n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__ \n\nI can never have enough pairs of black jeans, but right now I’m in the market for overalls, culottes and a denim dress. \n\n__What’s your go-to karaoke song?__ \n\n\"You Oughta Know” by Alanis Morissette, of course. \n\n__Who’s your favorite model and why?__ \n\nWell, it’s hard to pick, because I love models. But right now, I’m loving Cat McNeil. She’s confident, quirky and has amazing tattoos. \n\n__What’s your favorite Instagram to follow (other than Teen Vogue)?__ \n\nI follow a ton of models that I love, but right now my favorite Instagram is [@theacademynewyork](https://instagram.com/theacademynewyork/). They post really out-there images and quotes. And anything cat-related is always an instant-follow. \n\n__What’s your favorite meal?__ \n\nTacos! All day, every day. ",
