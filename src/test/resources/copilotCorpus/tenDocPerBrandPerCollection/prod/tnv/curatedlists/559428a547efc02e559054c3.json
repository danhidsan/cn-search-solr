Ballard’s thriller novel of the same name).

Somehow I got the part.” Jacob, whose acting background had been limited to participation in a few elementary school Christmas plays, was willing to get down and dirty for his role alongside Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey, which required motorcycle stunts and pistol handling.   \n__HUMBLE PIE__ Next up for Jacob is *Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials*, the sequel to the highly successful action movie *The Maze Runner*, starring Dylan O’Brien. “I try to be as natural as possible and look at it as having fun with people on set rather than acting,” he reveals. “Developing lifelong friendships is definitely one of the reasons why I love doing this.” With additional performances in the indie film *Little Accidents*, opposite Elizabeth Banks, and the *Texas Rising* TV miniseries on History, it’s clear that Jacob’s well on his way. *—NOOR BRARA* ",

He landed the part of Cole, whose foster-kid hardships were amplified by the struggle of being a transgender teen. “As a trans person, I’m really lucky to have supportive parents, which is definitely something Cole doesn’t have,” Tom says. “But I relate to him through the universal problems that all trans people go through. On that level it’s been amazing to watch him transition, essentially, as I’ve transitioned.”   \n__EMPIRE STATE OF MIND__ This fall, Tom will be returning to his stage roots for his first Off-Broadway play, *Hir*. He exclaims, “It’s so exciting and so crazy.” *—NOOR BRARA*",

His electrifying performance, and the film’s runaway critical acclaim, had all of Hollywood talking but came as no surprise to the actor: “As soon as I auditioned, I set my intentions — if I am blessed with the opportunity to be the lead in this movie, it’s my job to make it great.” Shameik’s talent is matched only by his amazing attitude. “I hope people are affected by my work in a positive way,” he notes. “I want audiences to leave with a smile.”   \n__JACK OF ALL TRADES__ The multitalented artist (he is also a standout musician and dancer) caught the attention of Baz Luhrmann, who cast Shameik in his original series for Netflix, *The Get Down*, which tells the story of hip-hop’s early beginnings in the 1970s. “I’m playing one of the founders of the genre, so there is definitely pressure to get it right,” Shameik explains. “I think everyone is going to fall in love with the character and the show.” We have a feeling he’s right. *—ALEXANDRA THURMOND* ",

I definitely want to do a movie or a scripted TV show.” With previous guest spots on *Drop Dead Diva* and *Pretty Little Liars*, anything is possible. *—MAXWELL LOSGAR* ",

Definitely.\n\n__What’s one thing you wish you could change about the world?__  \nThere should be designated \"no technology\" zones. It's really sad how many people miss cool moments because their eyes were glued to their phones. In 10 years, what will you remember—how many likes you got on Instagram, or the amazing adventures you were having too much fun to document?",

Not that she has anything to complain about with her adorable blonde, chin-length ‘do, cue Sally Draper’s infamous eye roll — but the 15-year-old starlet admits that even she wouldn’t mind snagging a few of her character’s ‘60s-cool-girl styles for herself. “Sally’s gone through so many different hairstyles, but they were especially glamorous in the later seasons,” Kiernan notes. “I would totally rock them now.”    \n\nIn her Teen Vogue video debut, the actress spills what it was like growing up on the set of *Mad Men* (she landed the role when she was just 6 years old!), learning to do her own eyeliner, and of course, maintaining her notoriously bold brow game. Watch the full clip to see what Kiernan had to say when we asked if she'd rather shave her head or her famous arches. Talk about a tough choice.    \n\n__Related:__ [Kiernan Shipka Just Pulled Off A Mohawk, Flawlessly](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/kiernan-shipka-pulls-off-a-mohawk)",

And of course, go easy on the eyeshadow (I was a big fan of the daytime smoky eye in high school...).\n\n__What’s your favorite *Teen Vogue* moment?__ \n\nImpromptu SnapChat photo shoots with Elaine Welteroth and Emily Gaynor trying on crazy-colored lipsticks.\n\n__Share a funny anecdote from a first job or internship.__ \n\nDuring Best of Beauty testing at my internship at *Allure*, we laid out close to 100 different lipsticks sans caps for the beauty director to review. Can you guess how long it took to match all of the caps to their rightful owners?\n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__ \n\nDolce and Gabbana's new matte red lipsticks. I very rarely rock lip color, but the shades in this collection may convert me to a full-time lipstick-wearer.\n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__ \n\nI can’t ever resist a great pair of shoes—even when \"window-shopping.\"\n\n__What’s your favorite meal?__ \n\nAnything stuffed with cheese and over 500 calories.",
