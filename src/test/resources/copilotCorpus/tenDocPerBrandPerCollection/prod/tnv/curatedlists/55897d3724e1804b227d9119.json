Ballard’s thriller novel of the same name). Stacy has also fronted major ad campaigns for Rag & Bone and Miu Miu. “Working as an actress and model has shown me how linked cinema and fashion can be,” she states. “It’s quite fascinating!” *—ARIANA MARSH* ",

Somehow I got the part.” Jacob, whose acting background had been limited to participation in a few elementary school Christmas plays, was willing to get down and dirty for his role alongside Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey, which required motorcycle stunts and pistol handling.   \n__HUMBLE PIE__ Next up for Jacob is *Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials*, the sequel to the highly successful action movie *The Maze Runner*, starring Dylan O’Brien. “I try to be as natural as possible and look at it as having fun with people on set rather than acting,” he reveals. “Developing lifelong friendships is definitely one of the reasons why I love doing this.” With additional performances in the indie film *Little Accidents*, opposite Elizabeth Banks, and the *Texas Rising* TV miniseries on History, it’s clear that Jacob’s well on his way. *—NOOR BRARA* ",

Just call ‘action’ and I’m there.”       \n__PARTY OF FIVE__ Tony’s next role is a field medic called Dumbo in the highly anticipated sci-fi thriller *The 5th Wave*. “I had a lot of fun training with the Army on set,” he shares. “It gave me a new appreciation for our troops and the other people who risk their lives protecting us.” *—MAXWELL LOSGAR* ",

It’s a privilege to portray someone extreme, who is so far from your normal life.”  \n__CHILD’S PLAY__ “When I was 8, I saw some kids on TV around my age and wondered how they got there,” Antoine Olivier shares.

The ingenue’s innocent on-screen appeal convinced audiences she was born to do the project. Director George Miller premiered it at the Cannes Film Festival, where Courtney was catapulted into the spotlight. “George is really specific with his characters — they come to him in his dreams,” says Courtney, who got the audition through her modeling agency (and went to it with some encouragement from her dad). After three callbacks, her life changed for good.   \n__HELLO, HOLLYWOOD__ When the young model found out she had scored the coveted role, she switched gears and dove headfirst into an acting career, subsequently landing a part in Alex Proyas’s adventure fantasy *Gods of Egypt* with Gerard Butler. “I don’t want to get stuck in one genre and be known as ‘the action girl,’” she says. “I want to do an indie next.” *—MAXWELL LOSGAR*",

He landed the part of Cole, whose foster-kid hardships were amplified by the struggle of being a transgender teen. “As a trans person, I’m really lucky to have supportive parents, which is definitely something Cole doesn’t have,” Tom says. “But I relate to him through the universal problems that all trans people go through. On that level it’s been amazing to watch him transition, essentially, as I’ve transitioned.”   \n__EMPIRE STATE OF MIND__ This fall, Tom will be returning to his stage roots for his first Off-Broadway play, *Hir*.

His electrifying performance, and the film’s runaway critical acclaim, had all of Hollywood talking but came as no surprise to the actor: “As soon as I auditioned, I set my intentions — if I am blessed with the opportunity to be the lead in this movie, it’s my job to make it great.” Shameik’s talent is matched only by his amazing attitude. “I hope people are affected by my work in a positive way,” he notes. “I want audiences to leave with a smile.”   \n__JACK OF ALL TRADES__ The multitalented artist (he is also a standout musician and dancer) caught the attention of Baz Luhrmann, who cast Shameik in his original series for Netflix, *The Get Down*, which tells the story of hip-hop’s early beginnings in the 1970s. “I’m playing one of the founders of the genre, so there is definitely pressure to get it right,” Shameik explains. “I think everyone is going to fall in love with the character and the show.” We have a feeling he’s right. *—ALEXANDRA THURMOND* ",
