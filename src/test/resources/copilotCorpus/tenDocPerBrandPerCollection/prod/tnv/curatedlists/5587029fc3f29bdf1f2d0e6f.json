      "body":"Some of you skinny people...you won’t get this,” comedian Louis C.K. says in his famed hilarious stand-up special Shameless. He describes what happens to him when he sees a plate of cookies at a party. Louis walks by it a few times, pretending to be casual. “Like, oh, hey, so who brought those? That’s cool…,” he says, circling. “I totally could *not* eat them, but I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings....” Louis keeps coming back to the plate, pretending to rediscover it over and over. He adds, “If people start noticing, you have to say something, like, ‘These are crazy. I don’t know what it is about them!’”  \n \nThe truth is, every kind of person—thin, heavyset, male, female, young, old — can experience food cravings. And a craving is separate from simply being hungry: It’s a desire for a specific taste, which often has little to do with actual hunger. Long thought to signal a physiological need for particular nutrients, cravings are now understood in many cases as emotional responses to boredom, stress, sadness, and more.   \n\n“My roommate and I will go to CVS at 11 at night, when we’re doing homework, to get cheesy cheddar popcorn,” college sophomore Miranda Ryshawy, 18, shares. It’s exercise that prompts Alexa Economacos, 19, to crave something sweet and filling. “I always want an açai bowl from Jugofresh after I work out,” she states. Minahil Khan, also 19, says that sometimes she *needs* chocolate: “I remember in high school I wanted it so badly by seventh-period French — I would just leave class!”  \n\nCravings are almost always emotional, according to certified nutritionist Kimberly Snyder, whose clients include Amanda Seyfried, Channing Tatum, Kate and Rooney Mara, Fergie, and Chris Hemsworth. “Check in with yourself when you’re having a craving: How am I feeling? Why am I so drawn to this particular food?” she advises. By becoming aware of what you chronically reach for, Snyder says, you are able to take charge of not only what you are eating but also how you are feeling.  \n\nEating disorders involve a similar lack of control over your emotional state, Snyder points out. But understanding the unmet needs that can drive particular cravings gives any person more power over them. Snyder’s technique, detailed in her recent book, *The Beauty Detox Power*, is to combine that concept with diet switch-outs that exchange the less-healthy craved food for similar, better-for-you options.  \n\n__SWEET TREATS__  \n   \n“People grow up with sugar as a reward — eating it can feel like a hug,” Snyder notes. “Say you’ve been studying hard, and you want praise; the lure of something sweet can be irresistible.” \n       \n__THINK ABOUT__\n\n What activities are you passionate about? Feeling rewarded is often rooted in doing the things you love.   \n\n__EAT__\n\n Dark chocolate is full of antioxidants, and most kinds do not contain gluten or dairy. Keep a bar in your freezer and snack on a square when you want sugar. Frozen chocolate is harder, so it slows you down as you eat, and keeping it stowed away helps so you’re not emotionally triggered to eat it from sight alone.   \n\n__CRUNCHY SNACKS__  \n  \n“In high school I was addicted to pretzels—it started when I was 13 and lasted a decade,” Snyder admits. The issue a crunchy craving can be trying to resolve is tension, she says. “It can come on when you’re anxious or angry and not facing it; chomping down on something can provide a temporary cathartic release.”   \n   \n__THINK ABOUT__ \n\nIs there something you’re upset about? The simplest way to decompress in the moment is to focus on your breath; a common do-it-anywhere trick is to imagine the word *let* as you breathe in and the word go as you breathe out. Exercise is also a powerful mood-booster, especially when it comes to quelling worry or anger.  \n          \n__EAT__ \n\nKeep washed, chopped, ready-to-eat veggies—plus healthy dips like hummus — handy.  \n \n\n__COMFORTING CARBS__  \n     \nCravings for carbs are often rooted in chronic stress, Snyder says: “If you’re always rushed, worn out, or over-scheduled, you might reach for carbs.” An apt term for soft, chewy foods like pasta and bread, “comfort food” has been shown to increase serotonin, the body’s natural antidepressant, in the brain.  \n     \n__THINK ABOUT__ \n\nLeave more space between activities and schedule less to do in general, Snyder suggests.  \n         \n__EAT__ \n\nHigher-quality, less-processed grains like quinoa or brown rice can satisfy the urge for something doughy. One of the quickest smarter-carb solutions is oatmeal—instant if you’re in a hurry, steel-cut if you’ve got a little more time. Snyder adds, “Lots of my clients who desire carbs and sweetness try oatmeal with some banana, and they love it.”  \n\n\n__Related:__ [10 Ways to Stay Well-Rested, Well-Fed, and Totally Sane at College](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/college-healthy-habits)  \n\n[#cneembed: embedjs/557f398061646d4fc4260000/playlist/55de2b0e61646d7cad00000a.js]||||||  ",

So naturally we couldn’t help but wonder what the sitcom starlet and her glam squad (makeup artist Allan Avendaño and hairstylist Ryan Richman) would dream up for this years’ award show. Smoked-out eyes and a sleek updo? Or old Hollywood waves and a crimson lip to match? The guessing game could go on forever…     \n \nNow don’t get us wrong: We love ourselves a good ol’ guess-the-glam game, but you know what we *Teen Vogue*-ers love more? Going behind-the-scenes, obv — which is exactly what we did, thanks to a beyond-gracious invitation from Ms. Hyland and her fab team. We settled in at Sarah’s gorgeous California home to record the whole getting ready process — and let’s just say it was everything we hoped for and more. Her rich burgundy gown, textured waves, and autumnal-toned eyes epitomized modern fall beauty (We def recommend trying this look ASAP!) and really played-up her incredible features.    \n \nWithout further ado, click through to see exactly how Sarah got Emmy-ready — and how you can recreate her look at home.

College classes and trying to secure internships and all that can be stressful at times, but those years go by just as fast as everyone says they do — so you've really gotta' just enjoy every second.  \n\n__Share a funny anecdote from a first job or internship.__  \nI interned at Refinery29 this summer and was in the kitchen area talking to one of the other interns — I leaned in to grab milk from the fridge and was saying something along the lines of, \"yeah I totally feel you homie,\" only to pop up and realize that my friend wasn't there, but the super-cute co-founder was… cue a major blushing moment.\n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__  \nThis is tough because I feel like I love so many things right now, but if I had to choose one, I'd go with these incredible new lip lacquers by Giorgio Armani (out September). They go on subtly glossy and leave behind this gorgeous, just-been-smooching stain that lasts me through burgers, wine, whatever. \n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__  \nDresses. Literally always dresses. \n\n__What's your go-to karaoke song?__  \n\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody,\" by Whitney Houston — it gets me so high on life that I don't even care about embarrassing myself. \n\n__Who's your favorite model and why?__  \nI'm not sure if I can choose — I think it's really cool (and refreshing) when models are a tad unconventional-looking or have something about them that really stands out.\n\n__What's your favorite Instagram to follow (other than Teen Vogue)?__  \nI'm a sucker for anything food-related (who isn't though?). A girl I interned with a couple falls ago started her own food Instagram over a year ago and now it's really popular. Whenever she posts, whether I've just scarfed down a full meal or not, I always find myself craving whatever she's having. You can follow her @gilliehouston. \n\n__What's your favorite meal?__  \nI have to choose just one?! Ima' go with a really ballin' burger and fries followed by strawberry rhubarb pie. \n",
