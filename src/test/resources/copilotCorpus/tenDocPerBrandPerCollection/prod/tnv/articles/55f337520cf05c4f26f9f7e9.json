  "body":"Getting back into the swing of things (ahem, school) after Labor Day is a serious struggle. It’s hard enough reprogramming your brain from “summer” to “study” mode, much less keeping up on the events of the world — so we’re giving you the low-down instead. Here are some of the big stories you might want to catch up on: \n\n__Is the #Thighbrow the New #Thighgap?__\n\nIf you've been on the internet this week, you might have found yourself saying, \"…What is a thighbrow?\" As reported by numerous news outlets, thighbrow is the new flaunt-it-if-you-got-it Instagram body trend. And good news, pretty much everyone has it (though whether you decide to show it off is up to you). [Described as](http://www.elle.com/beauty/health-fitness/g26746/how-to-thighs/) “a set of folds that frames the tops of thighs and separates leg from butt,” it’s basically that line you see at the top of your thigh when you sit down while wearing a high-cut bathing suit or underwear. That’s it. Luckily for all of us, bikini-pic season is on its way out and cuddly-sweater-cradling-a-latte-pic season is in. \n\n\n__Living with PMS That Makes You Want to Die__  \n\nMany of us experience monthly mood swings and irritability, courtesy of PMS — but for some women, the problem is far worse. Up to 8% of women are plagued by PMDD, or Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, a problem that leads to extreme depression for a couple weeks every month. The symptoms, which are both physical (migraines, sensitivity to light and sound, irritable bowels) and emotional (self-loathing, binge eating, tearfulness) are debilitating, to the point where almost 15 percent of women with PMDD attempt suicide, and sufferers as young as 23 consider getting a hysterectomy just to make it stop. “I had anxiety, panic attacks, mood swings — early on I thought I was bipolar,” Caroline Henaghan, a victim of the disorder, told [Broadly](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/living-with-pms-that-makes-you-want-to-die). The worst part? The disease remains largely a mystery, even to the medical community. It’s not clear exactly what causes it, how it should be defined, or what measures can be taken to treat it. Here’s hoping this problem gets the research and resources it needs. \n\n__A Teen Girl Band Fights Back__  \n\nThere’s no shortage of pop stars who ooze sex appeal, but that’s not what teen girl band [Kalliope Jones](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004849365292) is going for. Unfortunately, no one gave the judges of Northampton, Massachusetts’ Battle of the Bands that memo. According to [Mic](http://mic.com/articles/125111/teen-girl-band-strikes-back-after-contest-judges-say-they-weren-t-sultry-enough), the band — made up of one 14 and two 16-year-old girls — came in third place and received a scoring sheet from the judges that stated the girls were docked points because they didn’t use “the sultry to draw in the crowd.” Odd, we didn’t realize “sultry” was a requirement for being a top musician…and these girls didn’t either. “A woman’s sex appeal, or anyone’s for that matter, should not be the defining factor in their success in the music industry,” says band member Amelia Chalfant, who [shared](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=451159968388978&id=100004849365292) the story on the group’s Facebook page. Preach. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f33dbdceb4f8187e7aa5ce]||||||\n\n\n__Karlie Kloss Helps *Vogue* Get NYFW-ready__  \n\nNew York Fashion Week is in full swing, and *Vogue* set up shop at the YouTube Space NY for the occasion — but not without its fair share of chaos. Karlie Kloss kindly offered to help make the move, but encountered some, um, issues when she arrived at the Vogue offices. Follow her *very* real struggle [here](http://video.vogue.com/watch/karlie-kloss-gets-vogue-ready-for-nyfw).\n\n__LinkedIn’s Next Wave Introduces Major Influencers__    \n\nHow’s this for inspiration: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/hp/) just released [Next Wave](https://lists.linkedin.com/2015/next-wave), a list of 150 influencers from 15 industries who are killing it in their fields — and everyone on the list is under 35. Honorees include [Man Repeller’s](http://www.manrepeller.com/) [Leandra Medine](https://lists.linkedin.com/2015/next-wave/retail/leandra-medine), the head of [Airbnb’s]( https://www.airbnb.com/) art department [Andrew Schapiro](https://lists.linkedin.com/2015/next-wave/leisure/andrew-schapiro), and [Instacart’s](https://www.instacart.com/) CEO and founder, [Apoorva Mehta](https://lists.linkedin.com/2015/next-wave/retail/apoorva-mehta). “The interesting thing about this list is the number of people who were in a business, saw a problem with it that the rest of us would put up with, and…said they would do something about it,” Dan Roth, executive editor of LinkedIn, told [Refinery29]( http://www.refinery29.com/2015/09/93766/linkedin-next-wave-influencers). Excuse us while we go hustle. \n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f33f8fceb4f8187e7aa635]||||||\n\n\n__Serena Williams's Devastating Loss__  \n\nOn Friday, Serena Williams [lost](http://mashable.com/2015/09/11/serena-williams-loses-us-open/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link#ZtsMM2nUm5kY) her bid to create history, falling 6-2, 4-6, 4-6 to unseeded Italian player Roberta Vinci. After winning the Australian and French Opens as well as Wimbledon this year, Serena was thought to be a lock for winning the U.S. Open, tying Steffi Graf’s 22 Grand Slam win record, and securing a Calendar Slam, something that hasn’t been achieved since the 1988 (also by Graf). She may have lost her chance *this* year, but we have no doubt that next year the superstar will be battling back for the title. And hey, she did win *three* Grand Slams this year. Even though she didn’t win the title this time, she’s still #1 for us.\n\n__Right to Die Law Approved in California__  \n\nLast fall, Brittany Maynard made headlines after being diagnosed with a deadly form of brain cancer and moving to Oregon to legally end her life with prescription drugs — something she couldn’t legally do in her home state of California. Since Brittany’s death, her family has continued fighting for right-to-die legislation, and they’re getting much closer to their goal. On Wednesday, California's state Assembly [passed a bill](http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ln-california-lawmakers-vote-on-right-to-die-legislation-20150909-story.html) allowing physicians to prescribe life-ending drugs to terminally ill patients under The End of Life Option Act. The bill, which is strongly opposed by many, including the Catholic Church, still needs to be approved by the state Senate, but Maynard’s family and others fighting for this legislation are hopeful that it will be passed.  \n\n__How Muslims Were Stereotyped after 9/11 — The Hashtag Tells Their Story, #AfterSeptember11__  \n\nFourteen years later after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, certain minority groups are still stereotyped as a result. A new twitter hashtag, #afterseptember11, sheds light on how poorly Muslims are treated. Search the hashtag on social media, and you’ll find stories of hate crimes, shame, and racism that are nothing less than appalling. Jess Talwar, the 19-year-old Chicagoan who created the hashtag, told [Dazed]( http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/26355/1/this-hashtag-tells-stories-of-muslim-stereotyping-post-9-11), “I started this hashtag not to belittle the events of September 11. I recognize the tragedy and remember the moment I heard the news as a little kindergartener. The trauma and repercussions of this day have not been confined to 9/11…The Arab/Desi/Muslim communities are not some non-American group of outsider[s], and we have felt the effect too, for 14 years.” \n\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/anuvir/status/642138966028763137]\n\n\n__Back In The Day, Fashion Shows Were Fun__  \n\nGuy Trebay, a writer for the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-when-fashion-shows-were-fun.html?ref=fashion&_r=3), reminisces about a different era of fashion week shows: One in the '90s that included backless chaps, drag queens, and feverish crowds. Now, says Trebay, the world of fashion is so “corporatized” that much of that mayhem and, well, fun, has been stripped away. There is less whimsy, fewer crazy surprises (largely thanks to social media), and much more regimen — at least, according to Trebay. But something tells us, by the end of this NYFW, there will be at least a few brow-raising stories and images to share. What do you think?\n\n__Obama Won Big With the Iran Nuclear Deal__  \n\nWhile the 2016 Presidential candidates have been pounding the pavement, President Obama has been fighting for a different victory: a six-nation nuclear deal with Iran. And on Thursday, [he won](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/us/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-senate.html). The deal, which lifts sanctions on Iran in exchange for limiting their nuclear capabilities, was almost killed by the Republicans, but Senate Democrats blocked that option with a vote this week. The landmark resolution was hammered out after long months of negotiations led by the U.S. (with Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China by their side)  and will likely go down in history as one of President Obama's greatest acts as leader of the free world. That is, if Iran keeps up their side of the bargain. Only history will tell if the Republicans were a better judge of character or President Obama and the other superpowers that supported the deal. \n\n\n__Related:__  [Selena Gomez Says That Body-Shaming Hurt, But She Doesn't Care About That Stuff](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-weight-gain-body-shaming-album-cover)\n\n__Watch our October cover star, Elle Fanning, in action!__\n\n[#cneembed: embedjs/557f398061646d4fc4260000/playlist/55f038b161646d0af9000000.js]||||||",
