  "body":"If you're tight with your roomie(s), sharing your belongings is basically inevitable. It's like the sister you never had! Suddenly you have access to a whole new slew of clothes, shoes, accessories, even makeup — it's kind of the best thing that's ever happened to you. That said, sharing shouldn't always be a no-brainer type of deal. Don't get us wrong: We like to think we're some of the best sharers out there, but when it comes to beauty, it’s not so simple. You see, swapping certain prods with your squad can actually backfire in some cases — resulting in pesky breakouts, or even worse — not-so-cute infections. Scary stuff, we know. \nSo, to set the record straight on what beauty bits are safe to share — and which ones are a no-go — we went straight to the experts. Read up on their advice ahead, and be sure to think twice before you offer up your fave mascara.\n\n__Lip Liner:__ If you and your crew are all about the ‘90s (or is it Kylie Jenner's?) lip liner trend, you’re in luck. According to makeup artist, Gloria Noto, lip liner is safe to shell out as long as you sharpen the pencil and spritz with alcohol to make sure there’s no bacteria left on the nib. \n\nTry: [Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Lip Pencil in Bad Blood](http://www.sephora.com/24-7-glide-on-lip-pencil-P219001?skuId=1724921)\n\n__Bronzer & Blush:__ Good news guys: bronzer and blush are a YES — so you and your friends can all achieve the same just-back-from-Barbados glow. However, there’s one caveat: they have to be powder products. “Dry products for the face are generally safe, as they don’t transfer bacteria in the same way,” says Noto. “Though I strongly suggest using your own brush or applicator, because they can absorb oils from the skin and create bacteria,” she explains. Case in point: powder prods get a thumbs up as long as you don’t swap applicators. \n\nTry: [Olivia Palermo x Ciaté London The Cheekbone Cheek Blusher Bronzer Duo](http://www.sephora.com/olivia-palermo-x-ciat-eacute-london-cheekbone-cheat-blusher-bronzer-duo-P399702?skuId=1726827)\n\n__(Some) Base Products:__ You obvi never want to toss around a concealer that has a doe-foot applicator, as they’re applied directly to the skin and harvest bacteria. But, according to makeup artist Kristin Hilton, if your concealer or foundation comes in a tube or has a pump — that changes the game. “Pumps or squeeze tubes are always the more sanitary solution when it comes to sharing, so think of that the next time you shop,” she tells us. \n\n__Quick tip:__ if you and your roomie have super-similar skin tones, you could go in on a splurge-worthy foundation that’s safe to share — we recommend cult-favorite [Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/giorgio-armani-luminous-silk-foundation/2853110).\n\nTry: [Hynt Beauty Duet Perfecting Concealer](http://www.hyntbeauty.com/duet-perfecting-concealer-p/dc01.htm)\n\n__Lash Curlers:__ Hilton tells us that lash curlers are a go as long as you sanitize them first. Make it easy on yourself by keeping a pack of anti-bacterial wipes handy for moments when you need ‘em. \n\nTry: [Surratt Relevée Lash Curler](http://www.barneys.com/surratt-relev%C3%A9e-lash-curler-502978832.html)\n\n__Setting Powder:__ As long as you spritz-spritz away with alcohol prior to sharing, your whole crew can stay shine-free together. P.S. Don’t forget to use separate brushes! \n\nTry: [BareMinerals bareSkin Perfecting Veil](http://www.sephora.com/bareskin-tm-perfecting-veil-P389226?skuId=1727379)\n\n__Certain Skin Care:__ According to board certified dermatologist, Dr. Sejal Shah, sharing skin care depends solely on the packaging of the product. “You’ll want to avoid sharing anything that comes in a tub, jar, or container that requires dipping your fingers into it,” she explains. “The primary concern here is with spreading infections.” However, Shah says that anything that can be squeezed, pumped, poured, or sprayed out of the container are the safest — so feel free to rotate things like facial oils, mists, and moisturizers that come with a pump. \n\nTry: [Estelle & Thild BioCalm Optimal Comfort Rescue Oil](http://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/product/664471)\n\n__Related:__ [7 Face Washing Mistakes You Never Knew You Were Making](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/seven-common-face-washing-mistakes)\n\n*Check out these videos for more beauty tips and tricks:*\n\n[#cneembed: embedjs/557f398061646d4fc4260000/playlist/55de17b261646d7cad000000.js]||||||\n",

College classes and trying to secure internships and all that can be stressful at times, but those years go by just as fast as everyone says they do — so you've really gotta' just enjoy every second.  \n\n__Share a funny anecdote from a first job or internship.__  \nI interned at Refinery29 this summer and was in the kitchen area talking to one of the other interns — I leaned in to grab milk from the fridge and was saying something along the lines of, \"yeah I totally feel you homie,\" only to pop up and realize that my friend wasn't there, but the super-cute co-founder was… cue a major blushing moment.\n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__  \nThis is tough because I feel like I love so many things right now, but if I had to choose one, I'd go with these incredible new lip lacquers by Giorgio Armani (out September). They go on subtly glossy and leave behind this gorgeous, just-been-smooching stain that lasts me through burgers, wine, whatever. \n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__  \nDresses. Literally always dresses. \n\n__What's your go-to karaoke song?__  \n\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody,\" by Whitney Houston — it gets me so high on life that I don't even care about embarrassing myself. \n\n__Who's your favorite model and why?__  \nI'm not sure if I can choose — I think it's really cool (and refreshing) when models are a tad unconventional-looking or have something about them that really stands out.\n\n__What's your favorite Instagram to follow (other than Teen Vogue)?__  \nI'm a sucker for anything food-related (who isn't though?). A girl I interned with a couple falls ago started her own food Instagram over a year ago and now it's really popular. Whenever she posts, whether I've just scarfed down a full meal or not, I always find myself craving whatever she's having. You can follow her @gilliehouston. \n\n__What's your favorite meal?__  \nI have to choose just one?! Ima' go with a really ballin' burger and fries followed by strawberry rhubarb pie. \n",

      "bio":"__What sort of advice would you give your 18-year-old self?__  \nOh damn that was only a few short years ago for me, but I think I'd tell myself to just chill and try my best to always live in the moment. College classes and trying to secure internships and all that can be stressful at times, but those years go by just as fast as everyone says they do — so you've really gotta' just enjoy every second.  \n\n__Share a funny anecdote from a first job or internship.__  \nI interned at Refinery29 this summer and was in the kitchen area talking to one of the other interns — I leaned in to grab milk from the fridge and was saying something along the lines of, \"yeah I totally feel you homie,\" only to pop up and realize that my friend wasn't there, but the super-cute co-founder was… cue a major blushing moment.\n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__  \nThis is tough because I feel like I love so many things right now, but if I had to choose one, I'd go with these incredible new lip lacquers by Giorgio Armani (out September). They go on subtly glossy and leave behind this gorgeous, just-been-smooching stain that lasts me through burgers, wine, whatever. \n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__  \nDresses. Literally always dresses. \n\n__What's your go-to karaoke song?__  \n\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody,\" by Whitney Houston — it gets me so high on life that I don't even care about embarrassing myself. \n\n__Who's your favorite model and why?__  \nI'm not sure if I can choose — I think it's really cool (and refreshing) when models are a tad unconventional-looking or have something about them that really stands out.\n\n__What's your favorite Instagram to follow (other than Teen Vogue)?__  \nI'm a sucker for anything food-related (who isn't though?). A girl I interned with a couple falls ago started her own food Instagram over a year ago and now it's really popular. Whenever she posts, whether I've just scarfed down a full meal or not, I always find myself craving whatever she's having. You can follow her @gilliehouston. \n\n__What's your favorite meal?__  \nI have to choose just one?! Ima' go with a really ballin' burger and fries followed by strawberry rhubarb pie. \n",
