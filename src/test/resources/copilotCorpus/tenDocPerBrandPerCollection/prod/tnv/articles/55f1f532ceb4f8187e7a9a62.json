  "body":"Taylor Swift's friends are famous. They are beautiful. Most of them are models. And they seem to exhibit every ideal of modern-day best friendship: celebrating holidays together at Taylor's Rhode Island estate, gushing over Taylor's boyfriend on social media, co-starring in a music video that won their friend a Music Video of the Year Moonman. Yet, though the group is as coordinated as could be, not everyone is into their public displays of bestie affection.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be in the squad,\" Miley Cyrus said in an interview with the *New York Times* before the VMAs. \"None of my friends are famous and not because of any other reason than I just like real people who are living real lives, because I'm inspired by them.\" \n\nIt’s not just about her squad: Taylor’s habit of bringing up a seemingly random list of “friends” to the stage at her concerts was even hilariously spoofed by comedian and White Girl Problems co-creator Lara Marie Schoenhals. And Miley’s remarks echo an overwhelmingly negative response to Taylor in recent weeks. Zayn Malik retweeted a fan account [where is the embed] that questioned Taylor’s entrepreneurial motives, which led to a very public fight with none other than Taylor’s boyfriend, DJ Calvin Harris. And almost immediately after Taylor said she bought Kanye West’s “College Dropout” when she was 12 at the VMAs, someone paired her statement with a “why you f!cking lying?” meme, which quickly went viral. [link]\n\n[WGP EMBED]\n\nThe backlash is a shift in Taylor’s public image. In January, Ann Helen Peterson wrote: “Before her girlfriend-collecting days, Swift defined herself by the men she loved…now she’s defining herself by the women who surround her…” If this is the case, the squad narrative is as genius as it is empowering. But because Hollywood is typically a place where rumors of ulterior motives abound, Taylor’s friends seem at best, like acquaintances; at worst, like nodes in her media machine. (According to squad member Serayah, that couldn’t be farther from the truth. In an interview with *The Hollywood Reporter*, the actress says the squad is normal. \"She’ll text us and be like, ‘Let’s do this.’ Group message — it’s not a manager thing, it’s just a text...it’s never business, it’s always fun. Normality first.”)\n\nAs genuine as these friendships may be, each member seems to fulfill an archetype, perpetuating the myth that female friendship is anything but complicated. And since Taylor is a celebrity whose fame is basically unparalleled, it wouldn’t be a stretch to imagine that each member of her inner circle had to sign a nondisclosure agreement, effectively entering into a business arrangement. (There have been rumors[link] that Gigi Hadid was unhappy about the idea of such transactional friendship, but she still walked the VMA red carpet with the rest of her friends.) It’s one thing to want to work with your best friend, but another to commodify their orbit around you, much like, say, a Gwen Stefani Harajuku girl.\n\nOver at Gawker, Dayna Evans writes: “If female empowerment was really so important to Swift as a pop star, she’d bring to the stage her astrophysicist friends, she’d have an all-female backing band like Charli XCX.” Gauging women’s empowerment in this way feels more tangible — after all, representation is one of the most pressing feminist issues to date — but is that a fair assessment? Though we shouldn't hold up Taylor's squad as the ultimate, the onus shouldn’t be on the singer to represent the full spectrum of female friendship, either. Taylor engages with her fans on social media and truly seems to care about them, but her friendships [and her capacity to develop meaningful relationships] are limited by her fame.\n\nLike many young women, Taylor’s feminism is evolving, and she’s still learning from her mistakes. She’s not alone: every self-identified feminist in the public eye has had missteps. There have been big, embarrassing missteps like the Lena Dunham’s *Girls* backlash and lighter brouhahas over Beyonce’s choice to include Ronda Rousey’s “do-nothing bitch\" in her Made in America performance. What another feminist perceives as a mistake doesn't take away from the fact that these women are still sources of inspiration and aspiration for many young women. Beyoncé, after all, has consistently and authentically made her brand about feminism and friendship. And Lena recently founded The Lenny[link], a newsletter for and by young women (with her best friend at the helm, no less!). But these feminist choices evolve with maturity, and Taylor’s beliefs won’t look the same way in a couple years. \n\nThe concept of her squad is still fairly new, too, but seems more tired thanks in part to the instant access social media provides. Yet if Taylor rose to fame as the girl who wore sneakers and stayed on the bleachers, it might help if she were to to peel back the layers of ultra-perfect friendship to make her squad more accessible and believable. Though you should never put fights with your best friends on social media for the sake of seeming more “real,” flauting a seemingly-perfect friendship 24/7 is bound to give outsiders a hefty dose of FOMO. \n\nTaylor doesn’t owe it to her fans to hide or tone down any aspect of her very charmed life, but she still prides herself on being the outsider best friend to whom her fans could relate. Her loyalty and dedication to her fans, as well as her emotional rawness already puts her leaps and bounds ahead of most pop stars. And while the trend of #SquadGoals may not be forever, feminism and friendship as tools in Taylor’s arsenal have worked to strengthen Taylor’s brand and set her apart from other stars. If Taylor stays true to her enterprising and entrepreneurial self every step of the way, even her mistakes can have a positive effect on all women who want more for themselves — and especially on young girls who aspire to be powerful, and maintain friendships as they rise to the top. \n",
