  "body":"Yesterday, after singing his new single “What Do You Mean” to a packed New York City street on *The Today Show*, [Justin Bieber](http://www.teenvogue.com/tag/justin-bieber) was a little bummed with the way the performance turned out. “Next time I won’t dance because the camera’s right here the whole time,” he said, probably unaware that his mic was still emitting sound or that the camera to which he was referring was broadcasting his critique to the entire east coast. Many Beliebers jumped to his defense, saying either that it was a joke, or that he had the right to express his frustration. Headlines, though, were quick to [label it a fit](http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/justin-bieber-camera-today-show#.dkzERBB7w), and even a temper tantrum. Of course they would. They have been looking for him to fail in weeks. After all, Bad Boy Bieber gives them juicier stories to tell.\n\n[#iframe: https://vine.co/v/etLE71WZTXH/embed/simple](600x600)||||||\n\nThe moment wasn’t that big of a deal — we all have moments of frustration — but it was a fissure, a break in composure for a performer who hasn’t toured since 2013 but is now making the rounds again. It’s natural that he would be stressed and worn down, because not only is he promoting two singles with a new album on the way, but Justin is promoting something even greater: himself.\n\nThis minor setback comes only days [after he cried on stage](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-what-do-you-mean-music-video) at the MTV Video Music Awards. People instantly laughed at the display of emotion, but others were endeared by it. We’ve all just been so freaking emotional that we cry in public. Justin just did it on national television. It was a move he chalked up in equal parts to being a perfectionist — he had missed some steps, he told Jimmy Fallon — and also because the “last time I was at an awards show, I was booed. [...] I worked so hard at this album, I worked so hard at just becoming the man I want to become, and then like, stepping into situations, you can't help but feel judged. So I was feeling judged and just wanting to win so badly and just wanting to do what I love so badly that I just put everything on the line.” \n\nIt's not like he's never made a mistake before, many much bigger than losing his cool in front of a live camera. He was charged with reckless driving. He was accused of vandalism. He was arrested for driving under the influence. He peed in a bucket while on camera. And while the scope of Justin’s infractions vary in severity, each one was another notch in the public perception against him, which was already shaky at best.\n\nSince he re-entered the spotlight, he's done all of the right things: he’s smiled and performed and made his acts of charity public. He’s tweeted and Instagrammed and thanked the fans for giving him a chance. He’s found a reason for his acting out, a mix of growing up and being surrounded by “knuckleheads” who were influencing him. (He said he’s gotten new friends.) And he’s reminded everyone that he is still a heartthrob: that he is “a relationship type of guy” who “loves cuddling” but had his heart broken so he’s staying single for now. He even had celebrity friends hype him up, [a 77-strong endorsement](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-what-do-you-mean-celebrity-coundown) for the Bieber product. \n\nComebacks are rare, and people are rabidly waiting for him to mess up again. And while he's a pro at being in the public eye by now, he’s also still human, and he’s still figuring out what it means to be a man — and yes, even men get stressed sometimes. Men crack, too. Justin Bieber is not stoic, and he shouldn't have to be. He's at his best when he's vulnerable. Nearly every interview he's done recently has involved him [apologizing for a \"rant\"](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-where-are-u-now-country-music), almost excusing this very common imperfection. But that imperfection is what makes him so good. It makes us want to protect him. It makes us want to cheer him on.\n\nTrying to hide that humanity from the millions of eyes watching your every move would stress anyone out. A pop star can only apologize for being human so many times before the sheen of the very thing that we look to pop stars for — perfection — begins to dull, so it might almost be better if, instead, he kept being vulnerable and didn't apologize for it. \n\nMaybe we're the ones who need to apologize for holding him to a standard that no 21-year-old kid would survive. (Just think of the dumb things you did or do or will do at that age.) And if Justin wants us to really accept the man he’s become and the music he’s been making, he needs to figure out not what he means, but why he feels like he needs to say he's sorry.\n\n__Related:__ [Justin Bieber's Acoustic Version of \"What Do You Mean?\" Will Turn Every Last Human Into a Belieber](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-what-do-you-mean-acoustic-video)\n\n__Check this out:__ \n\n[#cneembed: embedjs/557f398061646d4fc4260000/playlist/558c45e161646d3eb8100000.js]||||||",
