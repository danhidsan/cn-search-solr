  "body":"[Fleur De Force](http://www.teenvogue.com/tag/fleur-de-force) is officially taking over the beauty world. The UK-based vlogger, blogger, and recent author of *The Glam Guide* has just added her own makeup line into the mix – you know, because she didn't have much else going on. After teasing the big news on her twitter account, Fleur took a break from her New York Fashion Week adventures to share all of the soon-to-be-released goodies on her [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/gcBxFClkBKg). \n\nFleur's collection has your beauty basics covered with everything from a cosmetic pouch with her signature watercolor and stars design to lip glosses and eyeshadow quads. We're especially excited for the glosses, which come in six essential color options and are a cross between a liquid lipstick and a lip gloss. Fleur is taking the best of both worlds, so you get the high-impact color of a liquid lipstick with the smoothness of a gloss — and they smell like vanilla.\n\n[#instagram: https://instagram.com/p/7gNnCCG5hS/?taken-by=fleurdeforce]\n \nThe whole collection is super affordable, with nothing over $8.99, and it'll be ready to shop internationally starting September 17 at [feelunique.com](www.feelunique.comfeelunique). The countdown starts now. \n\nRelated: [Your Favorite Vloggers Reveal Their Summer Beauty Must-Haves](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/youtube-beauty-guru-summer-essentials)\n\nCheck out these amazing videos for more beauty inspiration:\n\n[#cneembed: embedjs/557f398061646d4fc4260000/playlist/55de17b261646d7cad000000.js]||||||\n",

It's okay to be disappointed, but don't let it discourage you from trying again. And don't be too hard on yourself because things always have a way of working out -- I still need to give myself this advice.\n\n\n__What’s your favorite *Teen Vogue* moment?__\n\n\nGemma Ward's Teen Vogue cover from waaaay back in 2006. I was in high school at the time and she was my absolute favorite model -- it's still probably stashed in my room at home somewhere. Then, of course, having been such a fan of Teen Vogue, seeing my first post on the site.\n\n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__\n\nI could never pick just one, so bear with me here..the Dr. Jart+ Vital Hydra Solution sheet mask because it instantly perks up your skin, Rimmel London Wonder Lash Mascara, Charlotte Tilbury Beach Stick in Las Salinas and the Butter London Lip Crayon in the bright pink shade, Primrose Hill Picnic.\n\n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__\n\nTurtlenecks, dresses and boots -- always in black.\n\n\n__What’s your go-to karaoke song?__\n\n\"Spice Up Your Life\" or really anything by the Spice Girls.\n\n\n__Who’s your favorite model and why?__\n\nI've always been a big fan of Georgia May Jagger's quirky/cool style, especially after meeting her and learning she's also funny and kind, too.\n\n\n__What’s your favorite Instagram to follow (other than *Teen Vogue*)?__\n\nIf I want fun beauty pics, [@louteasdale](http://instagram.com/louteasdale). If I want to laugh, [@brosbeingbasic](http://instagram.com/brosbeingbasic).",
