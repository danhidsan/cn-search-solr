  "body":"[Rihanna](http://www.teenvogue.com/tag/rihanna) is no stranger to bold beauty moves. You can always count on the singer to show up looking fabulous — whether she’s wearing electric lipstick, shimmery smoky eyes, or just that incredible glowing skin. Recently, we’ve been loving what she’s doing with majorly unexpected lip colors. She even inspired a *Teen Vogue* [story](http://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/unexpected-lip-colors-fall-editors) where our editors rocked outside-of-their-comfort-zone shades for fall. Well, last night, Rihanna amped it up even more in the cool pout category. She hosted a block party to kick off New York Fashion Week at [The New York EDITION hotel](http://www.editionhotels.com/new-york) and showed up with an intergalactic, metallic blue lip. We chatted with her longtime makeup artist and bestie, [Mylah Morales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CgyBv4INwU), to get the 411 on exactly what she used to achieve the out-of-this-world color.\n\n“Last night was all about fun,” says Mylah. “It wasn’t a red carpet event, so Rihanna wanted something playful and youthful. Also, something that was long-wearing so she wouldn't have to keep reapplying throughout the night.” Because this wasn’t a formal situation, Rihanna and Mylah decided to go all-out in the lip department. \n\nMylah wanted the moment to be glittery and girly, so she started by lining Rihanna’s lips with…eye liner. Yes, you read that right. She chose an Urban Decay glitter liner option, because let’s be real, how many shimmery blue lip liners exist in this world? When you’re a top celeb makeup artist, you know all the crafty tricks in the book. To achieve the same feelin’ blue lips, start by lining yours with [Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil in LSD](http://www.urbandecay.com/24-7-glide-on-eye-pencil/122.html). Next, Mylah coated Rihanna’s pout with [Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick in Paint](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/liquid-lipstick.html) — a deeply pigmented blue hue. The glimmering liner below peeked through, and the result was outer space amazing. \n\n“For the rest of her face, I wanted to keep it really clean,” says Mylah Morales. “We did a classic black cat eye and an orangey brown shadow for warmth. The key to pulling off a dark blue lip like this is to balance it with bronzer and highlighter, so skin looks fresh and glowy. If you try this yourself, remember that this is the key to not looking so stark,” says Mylah.\n\nOkay, so now that this is going to be our major weekend makeup inspiration, we had one more question for Mylah. What’s it like dolling up one of the most glam women in the entire world? “We’ve been working together for over a decade. It’s like getting your sister ready for a party. We love to collaborate and have fun,” she says.\n\nHaving fun has never looked better. \n\n__Related:__ [Exclusive!

I stressed out over a lot of things—looking back I realize how big a waste of time that is. \n\n__What’s your favorite Teen Vogue moment?__ \n\nI have so many amazing *Teen Vogue* memories. I think my favorite was assisting on the Leighton Meester February 2009 cover shoot back when I was an intern. I was obsessed with Gossip Girl, and being on set in the LES with Leighton and Patrick Demachelier was definitely one the highlights of my entire college experience. At one point I had to stop pedestrians from walking into the shot and I remember thinking I’ve made it. Haha.\n\n__Share a funny anecdote from a first job or internship.__ \n\nOn my first day of my first internship, EVER, at *Teen Vogue* my purse hit the elevator alarm and the elevator stopped mid-ride—it was completely packed, too. I was mortified.  \n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__\n\nI can’t get enough of the Maybelline Master Kajal black liner. I love kohl-rimmed liner and this one is perfect. I also love that as it wears down you get an even more smudgy, smoky, rock ’n’ roll vibe. It’s basically the gift that keeps on giving. \n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__ \n\nI can never have enough pairs of black jeans, but right now I’m in the market for overalls, culottes and a denim dress. \n\n__What’s your go-to karaoke song?__ \n\n\"You Oughta Know” by Alanis Morissette, of course. \n\n__Who’s your favorite model and why?__ \n\nWell, it’s hard to pick, because I love models. But right now, I’m loving Cat McNeil. She’s confident, quirky and has amazing tattoos. \n\n__What’s your favorite Instagram to follow (other than Teen Vogue)?__ \n\nI follow a ton of models that I love, but right now my favorite Instagram is [@theacademynewyork](https://instagram.com/theacademynewyork/). They post really out-there images and quotes. And anything cat-related is always an instant-follow. \n\n__What’s your favorite meal?__ \n\nTacos! All day, every day. ",
