  "body":"[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/8b2190GBunw](758x426)||||||\n\nWhen the boys of [One Direction](http://www.teenvogue.com/tag/one-direction) launched out of NASA's Houston base and into your heart — just, y'know, in case they weren't already there — for their [\"Drag Me Down\" music video](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/one-direction-drag-me-down-music-video), it was literally out of this world. But we were a little confused about how \"I've got fire in my heart / I'm not scared of the dark\" translated to rocket fuel and spacesuits. Now, though, we have an inside look at the artistic liberties behind the shoot, and it's all starting to make sense. \n\nHarry Styles, Liam Payne, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson (but no Zayn Malik — we're still not over it)  take you on set with them at the space station. You get a closer glimpse at how they created those shots with the station speeding past them in the background, and see them chat with their directors between takes. \"We were just trying to think of what the opposite of getting dragged down was, and what could be more opposite than getting launched in a rocket up to space?\" co-director Ben Turner divulged, which makes total sense. \n\nWhatever the reason, the group look like they're having a total blast — and who wouldn't? Now if only they'd release that album, we'd be totally over the moon.\n\n__Related:__ [Here's What One Direction Has to Say About That Whole Break Thing](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/one-direction-confirms-break)\n\n__Check this out:__ \n\n[#cneembed: embedjs/557f398061646d4fc4260000/playlist/55e7b50b61646d791d000021.js]||||||",
