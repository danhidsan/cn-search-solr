  "body":"We finally got the low-down on [Ariana Grande](http://www.teenvogue.com/tag/ariana-grande)’s third studio album in just as many years, and thank goodness, because between her cryptic tweets and not-so-subtle [“hints,](http://www.musictimes.com/articles/44883/20150807/ariana-grande-new-album-moonlight-single-focus-on-me.htm)\" the “One Less Problem” starlet has been painting a pretty vague picture of what the tracks will be about. But Ariana recently sat down with *Scream Queens* creator Ryan Murphy for [her *V Magazine* profile](http://www.vmagazine.com/site/content/4875/ariana-grande-is-the-scream-dream) — and if anyone could get the dirt on what's *really* going to be on her next album, it's Ryan. \n\nAriana says that the album is “vulnerable” and “terrifying,” because it's the most personal music she’s come out with so far. Naturally, you’d assume there would be some bonafide breakup anthems included in the lineup, but, uh, you’d be wrong. As she told Murphy: “You know, people found out quite a while after it actually happened. By the time I was writing the new album, I had kind of moved on. It’s not going to be captured on the album too much. I’m in a happy place. There aren’t any breakup anthems because I had moved on. I was like, alright.” \n\nIt was only a few weeks ago that Ariana teased that the album would be available in October (later confirmed) and by her standards, that’s not too far away:\n\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/639192040778010624]\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/639193922393128962]\n\nUltimately, what we can piece together is that this album, and this moment, is going to be all about Ariana, and the rumored lead single “Focus On Me,” will probably be out on October 30. We may not have the broken-heart ballads we dreamed of, but we’re likely going to get some girl power anthems instead. Ariana’s not here to give us what we want, she’s here to give us what we need.\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/644001022919188480]\n\n__Related:__ [Ariana Grande Covered Justin Bieber's \"What Do You Mean?\" in Concert and It Will Be Your Everything](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/ariana-grande-covers-justin-bieber-live)\n\n__Check this out:__ \n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55847f7afb1995762be47c76]||||||",
