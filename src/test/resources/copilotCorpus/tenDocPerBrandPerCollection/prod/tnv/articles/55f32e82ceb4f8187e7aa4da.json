  "body":"17-year-old Lottie Tomlinson already has years of professional beauty experience under her belt. She's travelled the world with [One Direction](http://www.teenvogue.com/tag/one-direction) (her brother is [Louis Tomlinson](http://www.teenvogue.com/tag/louis-tomlinson), casual) and helped create all of the band's signature looks — the ones you carefully cut out of magazines and aggressively stalk on Twitter and Insta post-show. Or is that just us? And while we argue that Lottie probably has the coolest job in the world, working with a bunch of boys doesn't exactly give you a lot of opportunities to show off your smoky eye and [strobing skills](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/strobing-highlighting-makeup-technique).\n \nSo, with makeup maestro (and One Direction groomer), [Lou Teasdale](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/lou-teasdale-one-direction-groomer), serving as her personal beauty coach, Lottie's putting her makeup brush where her mouth is on her brand new beauty tutorial-focused [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsCGNdclqa4HDBtPD_plmhw).\n \nWith such content as her step-by-step for getting the prettiest pink sparkly lip in the history of ever, it's no surprise the British babe's vlog, which just launched earlier this week, already has 69,000 plus followers. Since Lottie's been sporting California girl-worthy waves and [Spice Girls-throwback mini buns](https://instagram.com/p/7Z15gVHL4V/?taken-by=lottietommo123) as of late, we're crossing our fingers for a hair tutorial to come next. Because if 1D is going to go on hiatus, you might as well pick up some beauty skills while you pass the time.\n\n__Related:__ [One Direction Is Maybe, Probably Releasing Their Album Friday](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/one-direction-surprise-release-album-siri-target)\n\n*See below for more amazing beauty videos:*\n\n[#cneembed: embedjs/557f398061646d4fc4260000/playlist/55de17b261646d7cad000000.js]||||||\n",

It's okay to be disappointed, but don't let it discourage you from trying again. And don't be too hard on yourself because things always have a way of working out -- I still need to give myself this advice.\n\n\n__What’s your favorite *Teen Vogue* moment?__\n\n\nGemma Ward's Teen Vogue cover from waaaay back in 2006. I was in high school at the time and she was my absolute favorite model -- it's still probably stashed in my room at home somewhere. Then, of course, having been such a fan of Teen Vogue, seeing my first post on the site.\n\n\n__What beauty product are you loving right now?__\n\nI could never pick just one, so bear with me here..the Dr. Jart+ Vital Hydra Solution sheet mask because it instantly perks up your skin, Rimmel London Wonder Lash Mascara, Charlotte Tilbury Beach Stick in Las Salinas and the Butter London Lip Crayon in the bright pink shade, Primrose Hill Picnic.\n\n\n__What fashion item seems to always be on your shopping list?__\n\nTurtlenecks, dresses and boots -- always in black.\n\n\n__What’s your go-to karaoke song?__\n\n\"Spice Up Your Life\" or really anything by the Spice Girls.\n\n\n__Who’s your favorite model and why?__\n\nI've always been a big fan of Georgia May Jagger's quirky/cool style, especially after meeting her and learning she's also funny and kind, too.\n\n\n__What’s your favorite Instagram to follow (other than *Teen Vogue*)?__\n\nIf I want fun beauty pics, [@louteasdale](http://instagram.com/louteasdale). If I want to laugh, [@brosbeingbasic](http://instagram.com/brosbeingbasic).",
