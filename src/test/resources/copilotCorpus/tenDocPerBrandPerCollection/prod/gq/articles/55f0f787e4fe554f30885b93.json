  "hed":"The Bella Twins’ Secret to Picking Up Women at the Gym",
  "body":"Nikki and Brie Bella, the WWE's resident mean girls, spend about as much time in the gym as they do in the ring. And they're both in relationships with two of WWE's biggest male stars—Brie is married to Daniel Bryan and Nikki is in a long-term relationship with John Cena. So who better to ask for tips on picking up a woman at the gym than the twins who've spent the past decade _literally_ picking up women?\n\n**Have your significant others had any influence on your fitness routines?**\n\n**Nikki:** Actually, when John and I first started dating, I was coming back from breaking my leg. Before that, I was just the type of girl who would do cardio at the gym, lift some free weights, and take some classes. So when I was getting back into shape, he introduced me to Olympic lifting. I always had this perception that when you lift weights, you're going to get bulky and thick. I didn't realize you actually burn a lot of fat and that it trims you down. So when John got me past that, I just fell in love with this style of weightlifting. It has totally transformed my body.\n\n**Brie:** If Bryan is like, \"I'm going to be at the gym here for two hours,\" it forces me to keep myself busy for those two hours. It pushes you more! And Bryan is actually the first relationship I've been in where my partner enjoys a healthy lifestyle like me. Even past lifting weights at the gym. I've never had a loved one to go hiking with me, or to do yoga with me. And that has actually changed me. Now instead of being like, \"Hey, lets go to happy hour!\" it's like, \"Lets go find this mountain to hike.\"  \n\n**It seems like people can never agree on whether couples that work out together are inspirational or insufferable. What is your stance on working out with your significant other?**  \n\n**Brie:** I think working out with a loved one makes everything feel better! And for us, we're constantly on the road. So I'm always looking for extra time to hang out with Bryan. When we get to work out together, yes, we're doing something for our health. But at the same time we're actually getting to spend some time together.\n\n**Nikki:** I totally agree with Brie. There is nothing better than working out with your loved one.  \n\n**If you're looking to impress the Bella Twins, is there a specific feature or body part you should be focusing on at the gym?**  \n\n**Nikki:** There's something sexy about a man or a woman when they have definition in their shoulders and their arms. When I'm at a restaurant, whether it's a man in a sleeveless top or a woman, I can't help but look. I like the definition in someone's shoulders and arms. It's beautiful.\n\n**Brie:** Yeah, it's easy to hide your body from the chest down if you really want to. But it's not as easy, especially in the summer and spring, to hide your arms. So I think that's something you always have to make sure you work on.  \n\n**What's the reaction most guys have when you tell them you are professional wrestlers?**  \n\n**Brie: ** Honestly, the overall reaction is how hot it is. Some guys would look at our size and the way we were dressed and think \"No way,\" but what they learned is that looks are deceiving.\n\n**From the female perspective, any advice you're willing to give guys who are looking to approach women at the gym?**\n\n**Nikki:** When she is on the treadmill, leave her alone! I can't tell you how many guys have approached me when I'm doing cardio. Like, I have my headphones on, I'm in the zone, so don't bother me. I think the best time to approach a woman is actually after her workout. When you're working out, you're playing your jam, you're in the groove, and you don't want to be interrupted. So guys, wait until she's done getting her sweat on.\n\n**Brie:** Exactly. Wait until _after_ her workout, then go up to her. Plus she'll be in a good mood because she feels good!\n\n\n[#cnevideo: /cnevideos/55f3329589c0d3e261b2186c]||||||\n\n\n",
