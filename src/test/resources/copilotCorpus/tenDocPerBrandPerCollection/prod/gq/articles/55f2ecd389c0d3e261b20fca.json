  "body":"Musicians have always loved rocking ties, perhaps because it’s a great way to flip off the establishment while looking oh so respectable. Or maybe it’s that wearing a tie will always make you appear put-together, no matter what havoc you wreaked the night before.  \n\nAs these rockers (and rappers) show us, a slim tie worn with a mix of casual and tailored clothing can have gobs of attitude—as long as you know how to finesse your look the right way.\n\nHere, we’ll look at ways to mix up textures (knit tie, chambray shirt) and tones (bright blue tie, light blue oxford shirt), or just say screw it and pick a polka dot tie, a striped shirt, and two different socks and see what happens.  \n\nTo help get you psyched on liberating your tie from meetings, weddings and job interviews, here’s a survey of rock ’n' roll freedom fighters wearing rebellious neckwear like total bosses—and not the kind that sit in boardrooms.\n\nThe Rolling Stones \n\n\nOne of the reasons musicians love ties is that they lend an air of respectability and professionalism to even the most reckless and ragtag crews. Just ask the Rolling Stones, pictured here at a 1965 court appearance looking like the sharpest bunch of delinquents you’d ever want to hang with. Mick’s square tie with the broken mismatched suit (an early Stones trademark to differentiate them from the Beatles) is a nice touch of sprezz. \n\nSam Cooke\n\nThere’s never any shame in rocking a classic solid black or navy tie, especially if the rest of your outfit is going to be doing a lot of talking. Take a cue from Sam Cooke, who would frequently pair understated blazers and ties with some funky checked trousers to create a stage look that is all business but never snoozy. \n\nKeith solo\n\nTo make your floppy tie look like just the right afterthought to a perfect outfit, skip the tie bar and allow both the front and the blade of the tie to catch some air.\n\nJohnny Thunders \n\nIt’s fun to dress up to mess up and no one did it better than former New York Doll and legendary clothes horse Johnny Thunders. We’re not 100% sure how to describe this outfit, but the photo serves as an excellent reminder that a white tie can be just as punk rock as a chain-metal belt or a big button.  \n\nJohnny Rotten \n\nThe first wave of punk rock was basically meat-and-potatoes Chuck Berry riffs—but messed up a bit. Similarly, punk fashions chopped up the “right” way to wear classic menswear pieces. Check out Mr. Rotten’s striped repp tie, done up extra sloppy, but with a rakish dimple. A clean white shirt never looked so dirty.\n\nJoy Division\n\nHere, Joy Division’s guitarist pairs a clean and slim micro-dot tie with a militaristic khaki shirt and some menacing post-punk snarl to create a look that evokes both order and disorder. Like the music, it’s sharp, to the point, and pretense-free. You can dress like this every day and look great. Blazer optional. \n\nAlbert Hammond Jr.\n\nA cool tie is a cool tie in 1965, 1985, 2005, or 2015, as the Strokes’ Albert Hammond Jr. shows us. He’s pictured here rocking a handmade silk jacquard tie from his capsule collection with (full-disclosure, yo!) my brand Jacques-Elliott. \n\nRobert Palmer\n\nIf you are going to rock a white shirt and tie with no jacket you need to either look like you just removed the top of a very expensive suit or like you don’t even own a suit. Both vibes are great, you just need to commit. Mr. Robert Palmer shows us all how to pull off the former with significant pizazz. \n\nAndré 3000\n\nMr. Benjamin (aka Possum Allawishes Jenkins Andre 3000 for short) shows us how to liberate our neckwear from the biz casual land of white shirts and blue jeans. But don’t be scurred: You don’t need to go full-on dandy like Mr. 3000 does here to get the flavor of the look. Simply wearing a tie that has a subtle round repeating pattern (circles, dots, microdots) with a striped shirt can supply you with a hot shot of sartorial funk. \n\nJanelle Monae\n\n*Elliot Aronow is founder of [Jacques-Elliott](http://jacques-elliott.com/), a lifestyle and accessories brand based out of NYC.
