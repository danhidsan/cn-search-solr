  "body":"*This is the third in a six-part series. For the full series so far, go [here](http://www.gq.com/search?tags=perfect%20crime).*  \n\nThe French cyclist was Sylvain Mollier, 45 years old, divorced, and the father of three children, two with his ex-wife and one, an infant daughter, with his live-in girlfriend. He was an avid cyclist, but he still appeared out of place on the road rising up from Chevaline, pedaling an expensive bicycle wholly unsuited for the ruts and dents of Route de la Combe d’Ire. “It was a little bit surprising to see someone on a racing bike, because racing cyclists tend to look after their bikes,” a British man also riding through Chevaline that day told the BBC. “Wheels are easily damaged on potholes and things.”\n\nMollier, until very recently, had been employed at a factory in Ugine, a little city a few miles southeast of Lake Annecy. The factory is owned by a company called Cezus, which is a subsidiary of AREVA, one of the largest suppliers of nuclear components in the world. In the Ugine plant, zirconium and hafnium and titanium and tantalum are melted into alloys and then forged into ingots and blanks and billets, which are crafted into components for nuclear reactors, primarily the housings for fuel rods. But Mollier, on the day he died, was unemployed, having negotiated a three-year leave of absence.\n\nHe was shot ﬁve times, more than anyone else, and also twice in the head. Mollier was also, in one possible chronology, the _ﬁrst_ person shot, two rounds in the chest.\n\nIn the weeks after he was murdered, Mollier was variously described as a metallurgist or as a senior production manager at Cezus. It was not difficult, then, to arrange the cursory descriptors of his life—divorced, unemployed, nuclear technician—into a plausible theory. There are many organizations and even some nations—Iran, say—willing to buy nuclear secrets. And there\nare other nations and organizations—Israel and the Mossad were mentioned most often—that would very much prefer such technology not proliferate. Killing a renegade French technician would effectively stop a black-market deal he might be brokering; killing three other people and trying to kill a little girl... Well, sometimes these things get messy.\n\nOr perhaps Saad didn’t just happen to be there. Maybe the French metallurgist and the Iraqi-born satellite engineer were in cahoots. Maybe they all got killed because they were all working together.\n\nEric Maillaud nods as those theories are sketched, his mouth close-lipped and gently curved in a way that is either weary or bemused. “For a novelist,” he says ﬁnally, “it is an amazing story.”\n\nHe smiles. His office looks out over the water, late-spring sunlight bleeding through a wall of windows, Mont Veyrier rising to the left and La Tournette, snowcapped and craggy blue-gray, hulking in the distance. But even here, in a medieval town cut by canals at the head of one of the cleanest and clearest lakes in Europe, murder is more two-paragraph tabloid than literature. Before _l’affaire de Chevaline,_ as it has come to be known, killings were no different from those in Cleveland or Atlanta or Albuquerque. “Murders,” Maillaud says, like cops and prosecutors everywhere, “are about either sex or money.”\n\n\n----------\n\n\nIt has been, on this particular afternoon with Maillaud, two years, six months, and 18 days since the al-Hillis and Mollier were murdered. In that time, investigators of course looked into Mollier’s work. The novelistic theory fell apart almost immediately, because one of the presumed details was incorrect: Mollier was neither a metallurgist nor a senior production manager. He was a welder. He had no access to nuclear secrets, and the Ugine plant probably holds none anyway: Its activities are explained, in great detail and rather proudly, on its website. (It specializes in “arc melting in a vacuum.”)\n\nNor, it turned out, did Mollier know Saad al-Hilli. There is no evidence the two of them had ever spoken, no record of a phone call or a text message or an e-mail. True, Maillaud concedes, they could have communicated via untraceable and disposable phones, but that notion wanders back into the pages of a paperback spy story. Besides, all of the dead had their mobile phones with them.\n\nIn those years of investigation, Maillaud also has come to agree with Zaid’s assessment of Saad: He was no more a spy than Mollier. His work wasn’t classiﬁed, and Saad most likely had his laptops and thumb drives with him because he was looking for a job. He liked the area and had been there several times before—not just the one time with Zaid and his family as a boy. “He was considered exceptionally proﬁcient, an engineer of renown,” Maillaud says. “It wouldn’t be unusual at all for him to ﬁnd work here.”\n\nSo maybe the motive was more mundane, no different from those in almost every other murder? What if it was sex? Or money?\n\nMaillaud knows that Mollier reportedly had a reputation as a _coureur de jupons._ A skirt-chaser. Maillaud says this with a shrug. It’s France. It happens. Maybe husbands get jealous, but enough so to slaughter four people and try to kill a child? “That doesn’t seem very realistic,” he says. Anyway, Mollier’s friskier days, if they existed, and near as the investigators could determine, were in his past. He’d been with his girlfriend, a pharmacist named Claire Schutz, for more than two years, and they’d just had a baby.\n\nThat leaves money. Three months after the murders, a British journalist reported that Claire Schutz, in the fall of 2011, “had become a paper millionaire” when her father’s pharmacy had been transferred to her. SLAIN ALPINE CYCLIST IN FEUD OVER LOVER’S FORTUNE, the headline in _The Sunday Times_ announced on December 16, 2012. According to the story, the Schutz family was increasingly displeased with Mollier sponging off of Claire. (A contention for which we’ll have to take _The Sunday Times’_s word. The Schutz family, through Claire’s very ﬁrm attorney, declined to talk. One of Mollier’s brothers hung up, and another, Christophe, stayed on the phone only long enough to say he wasn’t close to Sylvain and was tired of reporters pestering him.)\n\nMaillaud hasn’t been able to read everything published about _l’affaire de Chevaline_, but he’s aware of the basic theory: that Claire Schutz’s family had Mollier whacked for being a lout, and the al-Hilli family simply got in the way. Maillaud listens as it is explained again; then he shakes his head. This was investigated and dismissed long ago, he says. Claire was not yet a millionaire, on paper or otherwise, he says. She was buying the pharmacy from her father, albeit with a no-interest loan, and Mollier had no current or potential legal interest in it because the two were not married. And again, who massacres strangers over a theoretical future ﬁnancial entanglement? But he’s not surprised the story played well in the papers, especially in England.\n\n“It was not conceivable for many English people, including English journalists, that the problem originated in Britain,” Maillaud says. Then he laughs. “I think that the Hundred Years’ War is not yet over.”\n\nPerhaps. But it also was not conceivable for many people, English and otherwise, that dozens of detectives couldn’t ﬁgure out who killed four people on a forested mountain in the middle of a Wednesday afternoon. Nor, really, was it conceivable to Maillaud. Annecy is a tourist town, the villages and campgrounds dependent on holiday travelers, on hikers and cyclists and paragliders over the lake. Such people do not typically get shot to death. When they do, there must be—there _needs_ to be—a person who did it.\n\nAnd there needs to be a reason why.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n+++omfg\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f34e3b89c0d3e261b21cad]||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n[Chapter One: Murder in the Alps](http://www.gq.com/story/alps-murder-chevaline-solving-crime)  \n[Chapter Two: The Iraqi Connection](http://www.gq.com/story/alps-murder-chevaline-iraqi-connection)  \nChapter Three: The Cyclist  \nChapter Four: The Arrest  \nChapter Five: The Journalist and the Murder  \nChapter Six: The Perfect Crime\n\n+++\n\n\n----------\n\n\nSean Flynn _is a_ GQ _correspondent._",
