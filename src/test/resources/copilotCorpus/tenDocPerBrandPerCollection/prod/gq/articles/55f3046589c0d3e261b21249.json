  "body":"*What's in your refrigerator at any given time says a lot about you. In this series, *GQ* reached out to famous chefs with a deceptively simple, if revealing, question: What do you cook when you're by yourself and no one's watching?*\n\n\nChef Dale Talde prides himself on cooking defiantly inauthentic Asian-American cuisine. His recipes haven’t been passed down from generation to generation; they’re an amalgamation of who he is, and, crucially, what he likes to put in his belly. “To be honest, it’s just what I like to eat,” he says. “I mean it’s selfish, but I love burgers and nachos and chicken wings, and I also love the comfort of rice with anything.” \n\nThat’s why at his restaurant Talde in Brooklyn you’ll see bizarro menu items like pretzel dumplings, breakfast ramen, and his insanely delicious (if unholy) take on pad thai, made with fatty bacon and deep-fried oysters. A few blocks up the road at his after-work bar Pork Slope, he’s serving tater tots, cheeseburgers, and a pork chop banh mi. (Just don’t call what he’s doing “Asian Fusion.”)\n\n+++omfg\n\n>Once you know that everything’s mixed and it all tastes good, leave it on the stove and let it burn on the bottom. A pimp move would be to throw a fried egg on top.\n\n+++\n\nThis month, he has a new cookbook coming out titled *Asian-American: Proudly Inauthentic Recipes from the Philippines to Brooklyn*. And though he’d rather not cook for himself when he’s off work, he does have a go-to recipe if hunger strikes and his wife isn’t around: kimchi fried rice, a dish teeming with crispy bits of Spam, mouth-tingling chili flakes, and crunchy fermented chunks of kimchi. It’s not the prettiest dish. But it’ll blow your mind. \n\n__Dale Talde:__ “I almost never cook for myself at home. I don’t want to wash dishes. It’s more about being lazy than doing the other shit. I love to cook, you know, have a glass a bourbon. But it’s the aftermath, when the house is trashed. Then I’m like, I don’t want to cook anymore. I should’ve just walked to Popeye’s and had a fucking six piece and be done with it. \n\n“I love this recipe because usually I already have all this shit in the fridge. When I’m at home I want something easy and fast and tasty. Spam doesn’t rot, so it’s not going anywhere. Kimchi is already spoiled—it’s already on its way out. Most of this stuff I already have chilling at the crib. There’s always rice chilling somewhere. I always have soy sauce, typically an onion, garlic that’s in various stages of decay. Butter, always. For me one of the reasons I love this recipe is because it’s so damn fast. You mess this up, it still tastes pretty good. If I have turkey or leftover steak from dinner, it’s a good way to burn it out. I don’t want the steak to go to waste, so I’ll just put it in the kimchi fried rice. \n\n“Once you know that everything’s mixed and it all tastes good, leave it on the stove and let it burn on the bottom. A pimp move would be to throw a fried egg on top. This is something you can really stretch out to feed five or six people. How do we make this more? That seems to be a reoccurring theme for a lot of Asian dishes. \n\n“This is best served right out of the pan. When I was a bachelor, I would eat everything straight out of the pan. If I wasn’t married, I’d eat everything out of quart containers. Those would be the only bowls in my house. You can be lazy and cook great food.”\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f30926e4fe554f30886e4a]||||||\n\n__Dale Talde’s Kimchi Fried Rice__\n\n__Ingredients:__  \n½ cup           \tdiced Spam  \n¼ cup           \tchopped onion  \n1 clove         \tminced garlic ½ cup           \tkimchi  \n3 cups          \tcooked rice (preferably day old)  \n2 tbsp           \tsliced scallion, green part only  \n¼ tsp            \tKorean chili flake (red pepper flake can be substituted)  \n1 tsp             \tsesame oil  \n1                  \tegg\n \n__Directions:__  \nIn a hot wok, render out the Spam until golden brown and add onions and garlic. (Don’t have a wok? Use a cast iron skillet. “It’s one of the only things that will maintain the amount of heat that a wok typically can,” says Talde.) Stir fry for a few minutes until the onion is translucent. Add kimchi and cooked rice, stir fry until hot and the bottom of the rice is crispy. Add scallions, chili flake, sesame oil and stir. Serve immediately with a fried or poached egg on top. If your wife isn’t around, consume straight out of the pan. ",
