  "body":"Chances are good that 20 million of you will sit down this evening to watch men in padded costumes chase each other in circles and throw around a leather ball. You might as well eat some sick nachos while doing it.\n\nThis is where Friday Night Nachos come in. Every week of NFL season you'll find, right here, an original nacho recipe. And maybe (definitely) some spirited football talk on the side.\n\nTonight's game—and thus today's nacho—is remarkable for a number of reasons. It's the first game of the season, for one. Also, it involves Steelers fans, those football freaks who *literally* foam at the mouth as they wave their Terrible Towels like guerrilla warriors and dare anybody—even you, grandma!—to even *think* a bad thought about the Steelers. \n\nBut who am I kidding? Steeler fanaticism is nothing new. This game is really notable because it's all about pretty boy Tom Brady, the star quarterback/four-time Super Bowl ringbearer/destroyer of cell phones that somehow ended up on the sweet side of the law and got the go-ahead to play in tonight's game. (A pretty boy athlete getting a break by the law—imagine that!)\n\nICYMI: Last season the Patriots were embroiled in a scandal known as Deflategate. It was believed that [they deflated balls](http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/12202450/nfl-says-new-england-patriots-had-inflated-footballs-afc-championship-game) in order to make them easier to catch during the AFC championship game (the game that decides who goes to the Super Bowl) against the Indianapolis Colts. Brady later [destroyed his cell phone](http://deadspin.com/the-full-story-of-tom-bradys-destroyed-cell-phone-1722190784), theoretically to cover up evidence. Although he was [originally banned](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25181545/tom-brady-suspended-4-games-by-nfl-patriots-lose-2016-first-rounder) for the first four games of the season, that decision [was overturned](http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/09/01/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-deflategate-ruling). So tonight, Brady hits the field.\n\nI'm sure Patriots fans such as [my boss](https://twitter.com/ericgillin) (sorry, not sorry, Gillin) would love to forget all about Deflategate. But I'm Midwestern, and I don't want to be burned alive by the rage-lasers that shoot from Steelers fan's eyes, and this Deflategate drama is just too delicious (yes, I really just wrote that) to ignore. \n\n+++landscape\n\n[#image: /photos/55f08dadad4e361c200f798d]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n##How to make Black-and-Gold Deflategate Nachos##  \n\nStart with a bed of __yellow corn chips__. Top with drained __black beans__ and __shredded cheddar cheese__, making sure the beans aren't completely covered. There's your Steelers black and yellow. \n\nNow find the grossest, dingiest yellow washcloth from your hamper and drape it over the beans and cheese. There's your Terrible Towel. (Note: Don't actually do this.)\n\nToss [__whole cherry tomatoes__](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/texas-toast-with-roasted-tomatoes-and-parsley-56389818) (and __sliced jalapeños__ if you like it spicy and want to represent the stress headaches Brady must have suffered from for weeks now, except wait, no, you need a soul to experience stress) with a pinch of salt and scatter them over the cheese. Bake the nachos according to this [Ultimate Nachos recipe](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/ultimate-nachos-51235320) and watch as the tomatoes swell, burst, and deflate like so many tiny footballs. \n\nBring the tray of nachos to the couch and present it to your friends and family with a big smile. Now freak out a little. Run your hands through your hair nervously. Shake. When people say, \"Dude, what's wrong with you?\" say \"Nothing! Nothing's wrong!\" and take a handful of tortilla chips out of your pocket, hold them above the tray and crush them, pulverize them, *destroy them*.  Now sit down and start eating as if you didn't just act completely weird. As if you don't have anything—nothing at all!—to hide.",
