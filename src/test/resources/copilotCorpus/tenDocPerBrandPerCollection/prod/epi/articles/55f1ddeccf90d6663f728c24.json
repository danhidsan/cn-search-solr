  "body":"There's one thing that always makes me sad when I see it in a refrigerator. I'm not talking about ripe tomatoes, month-old Chinese, or a [magician's dove in a paper bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUKmq7UMJys). I'm talking about a half-opened can of tomato paste. \n\nThere it sits, its metal lid all askew, slowly drying out until you feel disgusted enough to finally throw it out. \n\nAnd it happens all the time. Why shouldn't it? After all, how many recipes call for even a full small can of tomato paste? Or more than one or two canned chipotle chiles in adobo? Sure, you could do the Martha thing, and freeze them in ice cube trays for easy single-serving use. But frankly I don't want to bother. Because there's another way. The Way of the Tube.\n\nTurns out, the supermarket is packed with tubes. Tubes that you can open and close in an instant. Tubes that can hang out in your fridge for months, keeping their contents fresh until you need them. Tubes that spare you from the guilt of throwing that dried-out can away. Here's the shortlist you should keep an eye out for—you'll usually find them in the international aisle of the supermarket.\n\n####Chipotles in Adobo####\nYou probably already love using the canned version of these ripe, smoked jalapenos to add heat and depth to your [tostadas](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/spicy-chipotle-chicken-tostadas-56389833), [chilis](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chipotle-beef-chili-with-lime-crema-102124), and [meatballs](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chipotle-meatballs-350594). The good news is, the tube version is even better—there's no need to mince the chiles. Just squirt and stir. \n\n[#recipe: /recipes/55afb241a188eea213e60ba7]|||\nSpicy Chipotle Chicken Tostadas\n|||\n\n####Tomato Paste####\n\nI've already mentioned how much I love this stuff. Sure, you can use it in tomato sauce recipes that call for a bit of tomato paste, but this stuff is useful anytime you want to add a dose of subtle umami to a dish (yep, tomato paste is a great source of flavor-boosting, all-natural glutamates). Just add it whenever you're making a [chicken curry](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/massaman-chicken-51223860) or [meat braise](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pork-and-squash-stew-with-chiles-51214660) (it's especially good if you add a spoonful to sautéed onions and stir to cook it a bit before proceeding with the recipe). \n\n[#recipe: /recipes/54a41f0b6529d92b2c0075cf]|||\nPork and Squash Stew with Chiles\n|||\n\n####Harissa####\n\nThis smoky, spicy mix of roasted peppers, chiles, garlic, and spices makes a great instant flavoring for roast chicken (spread it on the skin before it goes in the oven), frittatas, soups, and roasted vegetables. It also makes a great sauce when whisked together with mayonnaise. Start out with a small squirt of harissa—it's fiery stuff—and slowly add more to taste. \n\n[#recipe: /recipes/54a4217219925f464b378619]|||\nRoast Chicken\n|||\n\n####Pesto####\n\nSure, you probably don't want to toss your cooked pasta with pesto from a tube—it just doesn't have the bright green color and vibrant flavor of the fresh stuff. But if you want to make goat cheese and pesto mashed potatoes? Or pesto vinaigrette? Or pesto-infused artichoke dip? The stuff in the tube is perfect for giving anything else that pesto flavor.\n\n[#recipe: /recipes/54a4215719925f464b378501]|||\nSpring Vegetable and Goat Cheese Dip\n|||\n\n\n",
