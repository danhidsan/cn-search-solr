  "body":"You know what has everything going for it? A well-made tuna sandwich.\n\nIt's light. It's refreshing. It's creamy *and* it's crunchy. And it's not loaded with cheese or bacon or fried onions, so go ahead, call it healthy. \n\n\n[#article: /articles/55df53617f9541bd7c4cc35e]||||||\n\n\nBut here's a chilling reality: Most tuna sandwiches aren't made well. \n\nTake a close look around you. Every day in America, offensive tuna sandwiches are being slapped together with abandon. Tuna sandwiches topped with thick slices of *unmelted* swiss cheese. Tuna sandwiches served on sweet, toasted brioche. Tuna sandwiches stuffed with unnecessary ingredients like cherry peppers. Or cherries, for that matter!\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. In my home, in your home, we can make a difference. We can make perfect tuna sandwiches. Because we've got Sandwich Theory.\n\nTHEORY: KEEP THE SALAD SIMPLE\n-----------------------------\nAnother day, another person trying to reinvent the tuna salad wheel. Don't be that guy. Keep it simple. Use water-packed tuna, not the fancy oil-packed stuff you might buy for, say, a [tinned fish party](http://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/canned-fish-sardines-tuna-anchovies-dinner-party-article). Stir in finely-chopped celery (more on that in a minute), chopped fresh parsley, a few hits of lemon juice, and a good bit of mayonnaise, which will bind it all together and add lusciousness (yes, lusciousness).\n\nNow stop. Do not add capers. Do not add Dijon mustard. And for the love of fish, do not add chopped red onion.  \n\nTHEORY: KEEP THE CELERY IN CONTROL\n----------------------------------\nA word about that celery: Make sure it's finely chopped. You want a tiny pop of crunch in each bite, nothing more. This is a tuna sandwich, not a crudités platter. \n\nTHEORY: GO WITH THE (MULTI)GRAIN\n--------------------------------\nTuna belongs on untoasted, whole wheat multigrain bread, and nothing else. \n\nYes, you grew up eating it on toasted white bread, but that was just one of many mistakes your parents made. Sweet, soft white bread can't handle a salad as hefty as tuna. That's why you had to toast it. Multigrain bread, on the other hand, was born for this job, toaster be damned.\n\nTHEORY: LET SOME OF YOUR TOPPINGS LIVE OUTSIDE THE TUNA SALAD\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nAs I mentioned above, it's natural (but not okay) to be tempted to add red onion or—God help you—tomato to your tuna salad. But you resisted, right? Good. Because those vegetables actually go on top and bottom of the tuna. \n\nHere's the breakdown, from top to bottom: \n\nOne slice of __multigrain__\n\nThin slices of raw __red onion__ \n\n__Tuna salad__\n\nTwo slices of high-quality red __tomatoes__, sprinkled with salt and slightly overlapping like tectonic plates\n\nA few pieces of crisp __romaine lettuce hearts__\n\nA thick swath of __mayo__ (see below, haters) \n\nFinal slice of __multigrain__ \n\nTHEORY: DOUBLE DOWN ON mayonnaise\n--------------------------------\n\"But I've already put mayo in the tuna salad,\" you say. \"Why would I need more?\"\n\nBecause there's so such thing as too much mayonnaise. Because the red onion, tomato, and lettuce—those elements need mayo, too. And because if you don't, you just aren't making a proper tuna sandwich.",
