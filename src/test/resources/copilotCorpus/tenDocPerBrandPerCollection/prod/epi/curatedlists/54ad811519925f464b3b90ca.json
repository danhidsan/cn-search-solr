      "body":"When it comes to weeknight pasta, I have a simple, iron-clad rule: The sauce shouldn't take longer to cook than the pasta itself does.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I have nothing against pastas tossed with [long-simmered Bolognese](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/bolognese-sauce-107226). But that's weekend fare. On weeknights? Honestly, sometimes those nights are so hectic I barely have enough time to put some water on to boil and open a jar of sauce.\n\nExcept I've yet to find a jarred sauce I love. Which is how I started tinkering with fast weeknight sauces to begin with. \n\nIt's a challenge to keep pasta sauces to just 15 minutes. But it inspires me to deploy every trick in my arsenal to maximize flavor in minimal time. And trust me—there's a *lot* of flavor you can pack into a 15-minute sauce. The five we created here all include a few special touches that take them from good to great—all in record time. \n\n+++landscape\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f7270a3c346243461d492d]||||||\n\n\ntext in callout\n\n\n+++\n\n\n####The 15-Minute Meat Sauce####\nMost great ragùs gently simmer away on the stove for hours. Perfect for a lazy Sunday, but hardly a start-to-finish weeknight reality. Not too long ago I would’ve shook my head no at the idea that  meat sauce could be made in just 15 minutes, but this recipe proved me wrong. The splash of wine in this sauce (often used in long-cooking sauces, too) provides both flavor and a touch of sophistication. Using tomato paste in addition to tomato sauce—and giving the paste a quick fry before adding the liquid ingredients—deepens the tomato-y goodness and adds complexity. (Look for the extra rich double-concentrated stuff, sold in tubes.) A knob of butter stirred in at the finish adds just the right bit of richness. Pair this sauce with anything from short, chunky shapes, like penne, to long noodles, such as spaghetti or fettuccini. \n\n[#recipe: /recipes/55f7280b3c346243461d494c]|||\nPasta With 15-Minute Meat Sauce\n|||\n\n####The Cream Sauce####\nFreshly grated lemon zest gives this unctuous ham- and pea-studded number a hit of bright flavor and a little flair. It's surprisingly light (since it's not thickened with flour), elegant enough for a dinner party, *and* a kid-pleaser—in other words, this sauce is a triple play. While farfalle is cream sauce's classic partner, orecchiette or any sort of twisty shape will offer lots of little places for bits of ham and peas to nestle.\n\n[#recipe: /recipes/55f7288c3c346243461d4950]|||\nPasta with 15-Minute Ham, Pea, and Cream Sauce\n|||\n\n+++landscape\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f726b3e7f5be0c7ccb6e75]||||||\n\n\ntext in callout\n\n\n+++\n\n\n####The Pesto####\nThis silky basil pesto has a couple of tricks up its sleeve. Oil, garlic, and pine nuts are puréed until thick and creamy *before* the basil is added. This means less time in the machine for the tender herb, which helps the sauce keep its emerald green color and fresh, bright taste. A toasted pine nut topping, plus a little Parm and fresh basil at the finish, give this pasta extra class. \n\n[#recipe: /recipes/55f70963e7f5be0c7ccb6df7]|||\nPasta with 10-Minute Pesto\n|||\n\n####The Burst Tomato Sauce####\nCherry tomatoes blister and burst when cooked in hot olive oil, and their sweet juices caramelize to form this sumptuous sauce. While tender-skinned cherry tomatoes are at their peak in summer through late fall, they are generally available (and surprisingly good) year-round. A sprinkle of basil and a shower of freshly grated Parm make for a fabulous finish. \n\n[#recipe: /recipes/55f7086fe7f5be0c7ccb6df5]|||\nPasta with 15-Minute Burst Cherry Tomato Sauce\n|||\n\n+++landscape\n\n\n[#image: /photos/55f726b33c346243461d4928]||||||\n\n\ntext in callout\n\n\n+++\n\n\n####The Garlic and Oil Sauce####\n*Aglio e olio* (\"garlic and oil\") is the ultimate pantry pasta, a simple sauce you can count on when fridge is empty. But you don't need to be desperate to make this version, which gets an extra lift from anchovies, spicy red-pepper flakes, and crispy toasted breadcrumbs. Spaghettini (thin spaghetti) makes for good twirling and provides a nice balance between sauce and pasta, but traditional spaghetti works just as well.\n\n[#recipe: /recipes/55f709053c346243461d4906]|||\nPasta with 15-Minute Garlic, Oil, and Anchovy Sauce\n|||",
